GRC Transactions, Vol. 33, 2009",Keywords,"Perfluorocarbon, vapor-tracer, two-phase tracer, Freon, alcohol, water saturation, Darajat",AbstrAct,"Long-term sustainability of a vapor-dominated geothermal resource is largely determined by the injection of fluids back into the reservoir. Properly managed, injection generates “new steam” as the water boils when it comes into contact with hot dry rock in the reservoir. Without injection the field would dry out and production would go into decline. For the development of a long term injection strategy, it was decided to undertake a multiwell vapor and two-phase tracer test. By using both types of tracers, it was expected we could quantify the volume of injected water that was being boiled in the reservoir and produced by the surrounding steam production wells and characterize the boiling processes in terms of steam fractions. For time and cost efficiency, it was desirable to inject tracers into the three existing injection wells simultaneously. As multiple high-temperature vapor tracers for geothermal were not available, Chevron Geothermal Indonesia, Ltd., collaborated with Thermochem, Inc., to develop and test new vapor-phase tracers and to run field tests to confirm the tracers effectiveness.
Freon compounds, such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFC) and hydrofluorocarbons (HFC), have been used routinely as vapor tracers in geothermal. However, CFC’s are no longer used due to ozonedepletion issues, and the only HFC remaining for practical use is R-134a. Sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) is not used due to reaction with silicate rocks in the reservoir. A new class of geothermal vapor-phase tracers for geothermal applications, perfluorocarbons (PFC), have been tested in the lab by Thermochem for a preliminary evaluation of thermal and chemical stability. Two PFC’s were found to be stable to
at least 280 C in the presence of reservoir rock and water for one week. These compounds are very insoluble in water, so they had to be emulsified for application as water to steam tracers. Once the water boils in the reservoir they partition to the vapor phase and follow the steam path. The two PFC’s were tested along with R-134a and three light alcohols in the first multi-well, vapor and two-phase tracer test for a geothermal reservoir.
The results and interpretation presented in this paper are preliminary in that the test is on-going and some late return curves have not yet fully characterized. However, some interesting observations can already be made qualitatively about the relative response of the vapor- and two-phase tracers and implications for boiling processes occurring in the reservoir, characterization of fluid flow paths within the reservoir and the reservoir structures that are

controlling fluid flow movement. The observation was confirmed by integration of tracer tests results with geochemistry, geophysics, geology and production well performance data. The tracer results also confirm semi-permeable barriers within the reservoir, which will help design injection distribution strategies for improved injection management. The results will be used to develop alternative injection strategies to best manage reservoir performance and maximize heat recovery from the reservoir rock.",Introduction,"The Darajat geothermal field is located in West Java on the island of Java in Indonesia. The field, currently the second largest geothermal development in Indonesia, has now been under commercial exploitation since November 1994 and currently generating 259 megawatts of electricity which is fed into the national electrical grid system.
Darajat is one of five vapor dominated geothermal steam fields in the world with commercial operations. It is located in Garut Regency, West Java Province, Indonesia, about 35 km southeast of Bandung (capital city of West Java Province). The field lies within the Kendang volcanic complex, one of many volcanoes in the volcanic arc that extends from the northern tip of Sumatra, through Java, and eastward through the Banda Arc. The Kendang volcanic complex is part of a Quaternary volcanic range, extending from Papandayan volcano in the southwest to the Guntur volcano in the northeast. Figure 1 shows location of Darajat field and its adjacent geothermal fields, Kamojang geothermal field to the northeast and Wayang Windu field to the west.
Properly managed reinjection generates “new steam” as the injectate boils in the reservoir, hence maintaining reservoir pressure and increase energy extraction efficiency over the life of the reservoir. Reinjection of plant condensate would reduce the potential early reservoir dry out and field wide rapid production decline, however, inappropriate placement of injection wells, rate and duration of injection, could lead to premature breakthrough, reservoir cooling or waste the injected water, a setback to the goal of enhancing energy extraction. In addition, injection breakthrough could result in operational problems, such as derating of plant output, additional cost for makeup wells and modification to surface facilities.
Recently successful makeup well drilling to support the additional 110 MW power plant at Darajat with average well deliverability of 34 kg/s at wellhead pressures of 18 bara (equivalent to 21 MW), have increased management concerns about immediate short term needs to maintain adequate injection capacity to ensure plant reliability. Tracer tests have been powerful tools for understanding the connection between injection and production wells as connectivity controls the time of thermal breakthrough and rate of cooling of production wells.",Darajat tracer tests,"The first Tracer test at Darajat was conducted in 1998. The main objective of this test was to evaluate well connectivity and identify short term impacts of infield injection near the Gagak fault. Two vapor tracers were utilized, sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) and Freon R-134a, they were injected into DRJ-7, a well at the
center of the field. Among twelve production wells that were used as target wells, tracer returns were detected in five wells. The recovery of R-134a was 54%, whereas SF6 recovery was relatively small (0.3%). Given that SF6 was co-injected into the same well with the R-134a, we assume the SF6 rapidly degraded or was adsorbed in the reservoir. The results showed that tracer moved very quickly within the reservoir, at rates on the order of meters per hour or tens to hundreds of meters per day.
The second tracer test was performed in 2001, utilizing two active reinjection wells in the field, DRJ-3 and DRJ-15, receiving condensate from Unit-I (55 MW) and Unit-II (95 MW). The main objectives of the test were to determine the effectiveness of injection into the two wells in increasing steam production and to determine any liquid injection breakthrough. A simultaneous tracer injection using vapor-phase tracers (R-134a & R-23) and liquid-phase tracers (1,5- and 2,7 Naphthalene Disulfonic Acid – NDSA) were injected into the two wells. It was expected that the results of the two separate tracers would give different aspects of the movement and thermodynamics of the injected water through the analysis of the behavior of boiled injectate and its role in enhancing steam production.
A total of 13 wells were monitored for tracer returns. The R134a was detected in 5 wells, whereas R-23 that was injected into DRJ-15, was not detected in any of the monitored wells. The two liquid tracers were also not recovered and this was interpreted as an indication of no liquid breakthrough in production wells.
The recent tracer test was initiated on December 4, 2008, approximately 5 months after Darajat field commenced injecting into the new reinjection well, DRJ-12, to target the area of highest superheat. In addition to refinement of the connectivity between injection and production wells, particularly with additional makeup wells drilled in 2007-2008 drilling campaign, this tracer test was also expected to quantify the volume of injected water that was being boiled in the reservoir and produced by the surrounding steam production wells. After a comprehensive review of the potential long term benefits to injection strategy, it was concluded that a multi-well vapor and two-phase tracer test was the best approach.
Vapor- and two-phase tracers selection and Application strategy
Selection of appropriate tracers becomes critical in achieving the objectives as it determines the success and cost effectiveness tracer tests.
Two-phase tracers are considered chemical compounds that partition substantially into both the steam and liquid phases, with the ideal two-phase tracer having partitioning identical to water. Two-phase tracers (other than tritium) are currently limited to light alcohols, which have been applied only a few times in geothermal reservoir tracing applications, and never before with vapor-phase tracers. Alcohols have been used as tracers at The Geysers, Matsukawa, Japan (Fukuda, 2005), Coso, USA, and Los Azufres, Mexico. The selection of two-phase tracers for Darajat was relatively straightforward, aliphatic alcohols (IPA-i-propanol, NBA-n-butanol and NPA-n-propanol) were selected based on previous studies of stability, partitioning and their cost.
Vapor-phase tracers are chemical compounds with high volatility that partition into the steam phase and are useful in nearly all types of geothermal systems. They have been used in liquiddominated (Upstill-Goddard and Wilkins, 1995), two-phase (Bixley et al., 1995; Moore et al., 2000), and vapor-dominated fields (Adams et al., 1991; Beall et al., 1994; Beall et al., 1998). Vaporphase tracers are of particular importance at vapor-dominated fields such as Darajat and The Geysers (USA), where control of injectate is critical. Injection water must be closely managed to avoid breakthrough into production wells and to distribute the injectate evenly throughout the reservoir.
The earliest efforts to quantify injection-derived steam (IDS) in the production wells of vapor-dominated systems used tritium (Gulati et al., 1978) at The Geysers and the stable isotopes of water at Larderello, Italy (Nuti et al., 1981). Chlorofluorocarbons were used as vapor-phase tracers at The Geysers from 1990 to 1997 (Adams et al., 1991; Beall et al., 1994). Unfortunately, they were taken out of production due to their deleterious effects on ozone concentrations in the upper atmosphere (UNEP, 1993).
The desire to use three vapor tracers at once had been constrained in that only two tracers were available, R-134a and R-23, both hydrofluorocarbons. These two compounds were proposed in 1997 as substitute geothermal tracers (Adams, 1997) and have since been used extensively at The Geysers, and were used at Darajat beginning in 1998 as they possess good thermal stability and detectability for use in vapor-dominated reservoirs. The production of the vapor tracer R-23 has diminished and the price is now prohibitive for commercial application given its relatively high detection limit (poor analytical sensitivity) compared to R-134a. This has left the geothermal industry with only one vapor-phase tracer that is stable at temperatures to at least 250 ºC and does not adsorb or decay in the presence of rock. SF6 was proven to be strongly absorbed or decayed as shown previously from the Darajat Tracer test in 1998. This situation promoted the opportunity to find new reliable vapor tracers that suit the vapordominated geothermal environment.
Chevron Geothermal Indonesia Ltd., fostered collaboration with a leader in the field of geothermal tracers and geochemistry, Thermochem, Inc., to develop and test new vapor phase tracers and to run field tests to confirm the tracers effectiveness. The development started in July 2008, Thermochem screened a number of new potential vapor-phase tracer candidates for geothermal application in laboratory oven tests at low concentrations in water and the presence of reservoir drill cuttings. The tests were run at 250 to 280 °C for up to 1 week. Testing had to be on an accelerated schedule given the time-line required for field implementation, so the oven tests were not a rigorous evaluation of tracer properties. However, two hydrofluorocarbons decayed within 24 hours at 250 ºC and were immediately eliminated. The two PFC’s tested had no detectable decay at 250 ºC for several days and no significant decay at 280 ºC for 1 week. This was deemed acceptable for field implementation given that the reservoir temperature is about 240 ºC, and the time constraints of the test.
The vapor-phase tracers selected for this test were: Freon R-134a, perfluoromethylcyclopentane (PMCP) and perfluoromethylcyclohexane (PMCH). The Freon compound R-134a has a significant solubility in water, about 1500 ppmw, while the PFC’s are very insoluble, probably 10 ppmw or less. In order to ensure
there is no early gas “breakout” or phase separation of the vapor tracers before they reach the injection horizon in the reservoir, they are typically injected at rates that result in concentrations in the injection water below their solubility limit at the surface injection pipeline pressure and temperature conditions. However, vacuum conditions often exist at the injection wellhead for cold water injectors, so the vapor tracers may not actually be fully dissolved until some distance down the wellbore as pressures rise above vacuum. The relatively high solubility of R-134a allows reasonable injection rates and durations for quantities on the order of several hundred kg, but the PFC’s would require very low injection concentrations (<10 ppm) and long injection intervals even for quantities 10 times less than R-134a.
It is also important to inject tracers over the minimum time interval possible, whereas the ideal injection “pulse” is easier to interpret in the return curves, and return concentrations are higher and more likely to be detected. Therefore, efforts were made to increase the solubility of the PFC’s in the injection water to facilitate their use. Lab bench tests were run by Thermochem to find mixtures of solvents that could emulsify the PFC’s at concentrations of 10% in emulsion mixtures consisting of at least 50% water. Stable emulsions were sought that could maintain homogenous concentrations in 90% water or more for at least 24 hours. An emulsion chemistry was found that meets these conditions and used to inject the PFC tracers at concentrations of 30 to 40 ppm, in the injection water. Without proper emulsification, the PFC’s would have rapidly separated from the water given their high density and may have remained in surface piping and/ or passed into the injection horizons as a separate liquid phase in concentrated slugs.
The properties of the tracers used in this test are listed in Table 1, overleaf, in terms of solubility, vapor pressure, thermal stability, etc. Table 2, overleaf, lists the tracer injection parameters. The tracer pair R-134a and n-propanol (NPA) were injected into injection well DRJ-3; PMCH and isopropanol (IPA) into DRJ-15; and PMCP and n-butanol (NBA) into DRJ-12. Large quantities of the alcohols were injected since they are much less detectable than the vapor-phase tracers.
The two PFC’s were tested along with R-134a and three light alcohols in the first multi-well vapor and two-phase tracer test for a vapor-dominated geothermal reservoir. A total of 20 production wells were selected, including all the new make-up wells that have been put online to steam gathering system.
Preliminary results: Vapor- and two-Phase tracer return curves
The tracer tests indicated that the two new vapor tracers gave satisfactory results and their recoveries can later be used to measure how much injectate is boiling and how much is lost to the deeper reservoir. Thorough interpretation of the results is being carried out involving the vapor-tracer expert, Mike Adams (formerly UURI/EGI, now working for Thermochem). This paper discusses the preliminary interpretation focuses on the effectiveness of this trial of new vapor tracers and their role in assisting injection management for Darajat field.
The R-134a and NPA injected into DRJ-3 was detected in a total of 5 and 3 production wells, respectively. The R-134a injec-
tion gave consistent results to that of the same tracer injection into this well in 2001, except the recovery at DRJ-9 which was not apparent in 2001. The wells with the highest concentration returns for R-134a are the same wells with the highest returns of NPA, as expected. The earliest returns were detected within 6 days of tracer injection to DRJ-3. The vapor- and two-phase tracers each show very similar return curves shapes, in spite of the great difference in vapor/liquid partitioning. The shapes of the curves as illustrated in Figure 2, in terms of their broad peaks and long tails, are characteristic of relatively high water-saturation reservoir conditions for a vapor-dominated system. This is consistent with the low superheat of produced steam at Darajat compared to many areas of The Geysers and Larderello steam fields with low water saturation and high superheat.
The tracer recovered from DRJ-12 as shown in Figure 3 are of the greatest interest, as this well is the new injection well in the field and little is known as to the connectivity to production
wells in the field. Geochemistry monitoring as part of Darajat surveillance program has indicated negative impacts resulting from injection into this well and the tracer test results should be able to assist in mitigating possible injection breakthrough.
PMCP and NBA injection into DRJ-12 has proved to be effective, they were detected in 3 and 2 production wells, respectively, at significant levels. PMCP was detected in 3 other production wells at scattered levels near the detection limit. Returns were also detected within 6 days of injection, but in this case the twophase tracer returns have dropped-off faster than the vapor-phase tracer. One well, DRJ-11, began to show a secondary return peak for PMCP late in the test. Overall, the return curves are again characteristic of saturated reservoir conditions.
Although the highest recovery was observed at DRJ-8, DRJ-13 which possessed third rank amount in recovery has been negatively impacted by the injection into DRJ-12. DRJ-13 experienced rapid flow rate and pressure decline, the well was shut-in and currently

under observation to deduce the main cause of the decline and what stimulation is best to recover the production from this well.
To avoid further negative impacts to other production wells, condensate injection into DRJ-12 was decommissioned and the injectate has been diverted to DRJ-15. The injection breakthrough caused by this well was interpreted as the tracer favoring the shallow feed zone in this well. Explanation about this shallow zone will be discussed under the geophysics interpretation of the tracer tests.
The PMCH injected into DRJ-15 has only been detected in one production well at significant concentrations. Three other wells have shown low-level late returns. The returns for PMCH from DRJ-17 peaked at about 135 days after injection, so this will be a very broad return curve. The IPA injected into DRJ-15 has apparently decayed substantially and the reaction product appears to be acetone as measured in the produced steam from DRJ-17. Additional analyses confirmed this assumption and it was possible to recover the return curve for IPA based on the produced sum of IPA plus acetone. IPA has not been reported to decay in this manner in any previous geothermal tracer test, although it is know to be less thermally stable than NPA and NBA. Figure 4 illustrates the observed recovery of PMCH and IPA (including Acetone). The performance of PMCH supersedes R-23 which did not show any return curves in the 2001 tracer test at Darajat. Liquid saturation in the reservoir strongly affects the tracer response curve in vapor dominated fields due to phase partitioning of the vapor tracers, further review of the performance of PMCH in comparison to R-23 is being performed to validate the effectiveness of PMCH.
Given that the PFC and R-134a (and even alcohol) return curves are qualitatively similar for the wells where significant returns were detected, it appears that the PFC’s behave the same as other vapor-phase tracers. Specifically, the PFC’s appear to be similar to the Freon class of tracers which have been extensively used, but now limited to the one compound, R-134a. There was no evidence of
premature phase separation or gas loss for the PFC’s as injected for this test. In spite of their very low solubility, these compounds can be used as vapor-phase tracers in geothermal applications with adequate precautions in how they are applied, utilizing appropriate emulsions and controlled injection rates.
Integration of tracer results with other Field Data
Possible cooling of production wells, or thermal breakthrough, due to inappropriate reinjection placement and flowrate has been well addressed in the reservoir surveillance and monitoring program, which include pressure and temperature monitoring, geochemical sampling and analysis and also geophysical monitoring set up at Darajat field.",Geochemistry,"Geochemistry data, such as NCG and stable isotopes, has been integrated with well superheat and production data to determine injection impact or breakthrough to production wells. NCG is utilized for tracking injection breakthrough due to the fact that the injectate has very low NCG and its historical trend can be used to monitor its impact to production wells. The stable isotopes (deuterium and oxygen-18) in steam are also important since the isotopes of fresh meteoric waters tend to be depleted in the heavier isotopes, and are enriched in power plant steam condensate. The wellhead superheat data provides a measure of the dry-out conditions in the reservoir, makes it important for assessing the impact of injection
In addition, Boron (B) is also recognized as a good indicator for tracking this process. Boron is a constituent that is routinely measured in the produced steam and has relatively high solubility and thus tends to partition into the liquid phase upon condensation. This partitioning of boron into the liquid phase makes it a very

useful natural tracer to track chemical breakthrough of injected steam condensate.
It was observed at Darajat that there is a clear relationship between injection rate and well deliverability, superheat, NCG and also Boron in steam. Most recently, this was observed at several wells at Darajat that were affected by the injection into DRJ-12. Figure 5 gives example of reservoir and well monitoring in a well at Darajat (DRJ-8) that has been negatively impacted by an injection well. The flowrate of the well continues to decline as it has undergone the impact of injection. A field trend was established that such a decline in flowrate corresponds with decreasing superheat, boron in steam as well as NCG content. Prior to and four months after commencement of injection into DRJ-12, isotopic samples from wells that have possible connections were collected. An isotopic shift has also been observed at the affected wells, confirming influence of injection.",Geophysics,"The majority of the seismicity can be correlated with the injection of the condensate. A 10 station Microseismic monitoring network has been operated in Darajat since December 2006. The array consists of 3-component 4.5 Hz seismometers buried about 1.5 meters below the surface. The array was installed prior to the startup of Unit 3 to monitor the impact of the increased production and condensate injection on the seismicity. Results have shown while seismicity rates increased slightly the magnitudes remained
low with majority of Microearthquakes (MEQ) with magnitude less than M1.
Figure 6 shows a map and cross-section view of the distribution of the MEQ events and the locations of the 3 injection wells active through the period, DRJ 3, 12 and 15. The MEQ’s beneath DRJ 12 and 15 are characterized by clusters of events that extend to depths of about -2000 meter bsl. DRJ 3 may also have a deep cluster of MEQ activity but it is not as well defined. These trends of deeply extending MEQ clusters are similar to those observed beneath many of the injectors at the Geysers (Stark, 1992). Similarly to the Geysers these are interpreted to be induced as a result of contact of the cool water with the hot rock and subsequent failure of the rock along existing fractures (Stark, 2003).
The areal distribution of the MEQ near DRJ 15 are consistent with deep circulation of the injectate moving preferentially NW of the Gagak fault. In this case, the MEQ results indicated deep circulation of the injectate, consistent with the lack of tracer returns (except DRJ 17). Prior to the tracer test into DRJ 12 the deep cluster of MEQ activity near the well was interpreted to be a good sign that this well would have similar characteristics to those observed with DRJ 15. However, the tracer tests have shown this not to be the case, with rapid returns of tracers in many wells. The difference between these two wells is that DRJ 12 has dominantly shallow entries, whereas DRJ 15 has only deep entries. As shown on the cross-section there is not a seismic signature for injectate that moves out of shallow entries into the reservoir from either DRJ 12 or DRJ 3.",Geology,"Figure 7 shows Image log and core data where the dips of open fractures in Darajat are mostly greater than 40 degrees. The fracture strikes are dominantly in NNE-SSW, NE-SW and NWSE orientations. These orientations are consistent with surface faults identified from topographic maps and aerial photography as well as subsurface structures identified from the alignment of MEQ events.
The orientation of effective fractures shows similar trends. The effective fractures strike mostly NE-SW and NNE-SSW. The intersection of the two fracture sets may provide good reservoir connectivity, allowing the NE-SW faults to provide more production to the wells.
R-134a injected into DRJ-3 was recovered with high recovery at DRJ-7 and DRJ-23 and highest peak at DRJ-24, suggested that the fracture set NE-SW controls the injectate fluid path. The travel of the tracer N-S congested at DRJ-9 and no recovery at wells having feed zones in NE of Gagak Fault indicated this fault acts as a barrier to the fluid movement from the injector. This barrier interpretation is supported by the PMCH tracer injection into DRJ-15, which was recovered at DRJ-17, an indication of fluid remaining northwest of the Gagak fault. PMCP recovery appears
to support the NE-SW fracture set injectate path control, the recovery at DRJ-17 is supported by the orientation of the fracture at this well which allows the injectate to move North.
In general, there is a good correlation between the movement of the fluid from tracer tests and fracture orientation in Darajat field and that the Gagak fault acts as barrier of tracer movement from wells at the SW of the fault.",Implications for Darajat Injection Management,"Long-term reinjection management strategy at Darajat focuses on the following key issues 1) provide pressure and production support, 2) prevent injection breakthrough, 3) manage and minimize potential scaling and corrosion at both reservoir and surface facilities and 4) promote and sustain long term energy recovery. The results of the third tracer test at Darajat and the integrated interpretations have significant implications to Darajat Field injection management. Injection Target. It has been a best practice in Darajat that 1. condensate reinjection should targets areas of high superheat in the field. The characteristic of relatively high water-saturation reservoir conditions indicated by the shape of the tracer return curves has suggested the injection target should be optimized for long-term injection management. Infield injection or injection outside reservoir boundary must be taken into highest consideration. Shallow versus Deep Injection; Integrated tracer data inter-2. pretation has indicated that the shallow entry at DRJ-12 has detrimental effect to the infield injection. This has implied that future injection should consider targeting deep entries for injection wells. This shallow versus deep injection premise must be reviewed and tested in the field as the current injection wells receive relatively high injection rate. Injection Flowrate; The relationship of injection rate to changes 3. in NCG, superheat, decline and isotopic in production wells has indicated the sensitivity of these parameters. A sprinkle injection within the field should be considered and reviewed for future injection strategy. A pilot test may be worth implemented to acquire value of information for future use. Duration; The 2001 and recent tracers utilized two common 4. injection wells, DRJ-3 and DRJ-15. Combining the interpretation of tracer with Boron, the shallow entry at DRJ-3 has contributed in the decline of the wells in the southern part of the field. Although relatively small injection has been put into this well, the duration of injection into this well appears to be of greatest concern. A Huff and Puff injection should be included in the injection strategy evaluation. Potential Scaling; Injection breakthrough would enhance the 5. potential scaling deposition in wellbore, reservoir and surface facilities. From the tracer test, communication amongst wells and different fluid flow path between various injector-producer well pair can be demonstrated. This information will be valuable in predicting potential scaling at the producing well.",Acknowledgement,"The authors would like to thank the management of Chevron Geothermal Indonesia Ltd. for the funding approval to the devel-

Properly managed, injection generates “new steam” as the water boils when it comes into contact with hot dry rock in the reservoir. Without injection the field would dry out and production would go into decline. For the development of a long term injection strategy, it was decided to undertake a multiwell vapor and two-phase tracer test. By using both types of tracers, it was expected we could quantify the volume of injected water that was being boiled in the reservoir and produced by the surrounding steam production wells and characterize the boiling processes in terms of steam fractions. For time and cost efficiency, it was desirable to inject tracers into the three existing injection wells simultaneously. As multiple high-temperature vapor tracers for geothermal were not available, Chevron Geothermal Indonesia, Ltd., collaborated with Thermochem, Inc., to develop and test new vapor-phase tracers and to run field tests to confirm the tracers effectiveness. Freon compounds, such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFC) and hydrofluorocarbons (HFC), have been used routinely as vapor tracers in geothermal. However, CFC’s are no longer used due to ozonedepletion issues, and the only HFC remaining for practical use is R-134a. Sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) is not used due to reaction with silicate rocks in the reservoir. A new class of geothermal vapor-phase tracers for geothermal applications, perfluorocarbons (PFC), have been tested in the lab by Thermochem for a preliminary evaluation of thermal and chemical stability. Two PFC’s were found to be stable to at least 280 C in the presence of reservoir rock and water for one week. These compounds are very insoluble in water, so they had to be emulsified for application as water to steam tracers. Once the water boils in the reservoir they partition to the vapor phase and follow the steam path. The two PFC’s were tested along with R-134a and three light alcohols in the first multi-well, vapor and two-phase tracer test for a geothermal reservoir. The results and interpretation presented in this paper are preliminary in that the test is on-going and some late return curves have not yet fully characterized. However, some interesting observations can already be made qualitatively about the relative response of the vaporand two-phase tracers and implications for boiling processes occurring in the reservoir, characterization of fluid flow paths within the reservoir and the reservoir structures that are results of the First Application of Perfluorocarbons and Alcohols in a Multi-Well Vapor and two-Phase tracer test at the Darajat Geothermal Field, Indonesia, and Implications for Injection Management Arias sugandhi1, Paul N.

Over the last decade, the development and commercialization of direct hydraulic fracture diagnostics [Barree et al., 2002; Cipolla and Wright, 2000; Wright et al., 1999] has helped to improve our understanding about the physics of fracture growth. Fracture diagnostics are now routinely used to determine fracture length, height, orientation and proppant placement. These measurements help to improve stimulation design and execution in oil and gas applications. We can also utilize these lessons learned from the oilfi eld to evaluate the challenge to obtain an effective stimulation and fl uid diversion in EGS wells.
In many oilfi eld applications, multiple target zones are penetrated by a single well; in some fi elds, the pay
interval that contains hydrocarbons can have a thickness of several thousand feet. With the absence of an effective wellbore distribution strategy, hydraulic fractures will typically grow in the layers that provide the least resistance, i.e., the zones in which the fracture closure stress is lowest. Consequently, a stimulation treatment that would target all pay zones at once could end up covering only a very small portion of the interval, as shown in Figure 1. Many techniques have been developed in the oilfi eld to improve fl uid diversion and fracture penetration over the entire thickness of the target zone.
Until recently, the desire in oilfi eld stimulation has been on creating and extending a simple fracture system within a reservoir. However, in several newly developed reservoirs such as the Barnett Shale, the emphasis has been on creating a complex fracture network, since this is the only viable way to create an economic production response from ultra–low permeability rock. Similarly, for successful and cost–effective EGS development, it is also necessary to create an extensive and complex fracture network to achieve the maximum contact with the heat source while minimizing the potential for short circuiting.
Various techniques have been developed by the oil and gas industry to encourage fl uid diversion over the thickness of the target interval and lateral diversion throughout the reservoir. In EGS, the use of some of these diversion techniques is challenging, as most wells that have been used for EGS have long open-hole completions. This includes wells drilled specifi cally for EGS development (e.g., at the European HDR project in Soultz-sous-Fôrets) and “wells of opportunity,” which are typically non-productive or marginally productive geothermal wells (such as those investigated at the Coso and Desert Peak EGS projects in the US).
This paper is aimed directly at the practical goal of improving the effectiveness of EGS stimulations, to enable the delivery of more geothermal power at less cost. For this purpose, the paper provides an overview of techniques that are commonly used for hydraulic fracturing in the oilfi eld, and evaluates their effectiveness in improving stimulation and diversion for EGS wells.
Zonal Isolation and Height Diversion",Made Easy—Cased Wells,"Cased and lined wells have a large diameter pipe placed and cemented along the entire well or along subsections, respectively. The casing and liner provide signifi cant advantages over open hole completions: (i) protect the up–hole layers from fl uids, pressures, and well stability problems; (ii) protect fresh–water formations; and, (iii) isolate zones of lost returns or formations with signifi cantly different pressure gradients. In particular, the casing allows mechanical isolation, and the perforations in cased wells are benefi cial for mechanical and chemical diversion. This makes cased wells very attractive for most stimulation and diversion techniques. While geothermal wells are cased above the reservoir for these same reasons, perforated casings through the production intervals of geothermal wells are not used because of the requirement for much greater per-well fl ow rates in geothermal compared to oil & gas wells. It has been found that perforating through cemented casings does not permit suffi cient fl ow from the formation to the wellbore for traditional geothermal (non-EGS) wells. However, since EGS development is experimental at this stage, EGS wells are not expected to yield the same production rates as traditional geothermal wells. That is, it may be possible that an EGS well with a perforated, cemented casing may be able to achieve the injection rates needed for stimulation and the fl ow rates or injection rates needed during routine operation. If so, the cased and perforated completion and all the diversion techniques that are facilitated by this completion may be applicable to EGS.
Various isolation techniques can be used to temporarily isolate target zones from each other and from the rest of the well [Economides and Nolte, 2000]. These isolated zones can be stimulated separately or simultaneously. A fi rst requirement for proper isolation is achieving a good cement bond between perforated intervals. Various types of casing plugs for zonal isolation are available for conventional bottom–to–top treatment stage stimulation. Typically, perforations are shot in the casing, a fracture stimulation treatment is conducted,
and the stimulated zone is isolated from new perforations that will be treated up–hole. Mechanical bridge plugs can be run on tubulars or wireline [Brown et al., 2000]. Sand plugs can also be pumped (sometimes as part of the propped fracture treatment) to cover a previously stimulated perforated interval. Bridge plugs are the most reliable and commonly used method to provide adequate isolation between perforated zones. Frac baffl es are concentric baffl e rings that are run as part of the casing string and are placed between individual target zones [Brown et al., 2000; Robert and Rossen, 2000]. Isolation is achieved by dropping balls or running wireline plugs that seat in the baffl e rings. Some of these techniques are limited to vertical or near–vertical wells.
There is always an economic trade–off between the number of fracture treatments and the ability to achieve effective fl uid diversion. In cased wells, there are several perforation schemes that can help to create good vertical coverage (refer to Figure 1) [Minner et al., 1996]:
A. Limited entry perforation distributions are used to obtain simultaneous fl uid fl ow through certain perforations by creating a large frictional pressure drop across these perforations [Elbel and Britt, 2000]. The high frictional pressure drop is designed to offset the stress differences between target zones to enhance injection into all the perforated target zones [Lagrone and Rasmussen, 1963]. However, a suffi cient injection rate must be available to maintain this high differential pressure across the perforations, both initially and as the perforations are eroded by proppant.
B. Unrestricted entry perforating using a long interval, somewhat similar to the use of an open hole interval. There is considerably less initial control over fracture treatment distribution, as differences in closure stresses along the depth of the well dictate where fracture growth will occur. Ball sealers are sometimes used in conjunction with unrestricted entry treatments. Ball sealers are small spheres that are added to the fracturing fl uid to seal the perforations on the inside of the casing that accept the largest quantities of fl uid [Robert and Rossen, 2000]. However, their sealing effi ciency is very unpredictable.
C. Point source perforation distribution is used to obtain fl uid fl ow through only very few perforations in a single, very limited part of the well [Underwood and Kerley, 2000]. This tends to produce very few fractures or only a single fracture. While it does not suffer from adverse fl uid fl ow distributions and diffi cult proppant placement, it could stimulate only a very small target zone due to limited height growth as a result of fracture containment.
D. Multiple point source / limited entry perforating is a hybrid strategy that consists of limited entry (500+ psi perforation pressure drop) implemented in the form of, e.g., three point source perforation intervals. This strategy would have the advantage of point source perforations of initiating fewer fracture multiples at the wellbore, resulting in larger fracture dimensions and greater proppant concentration per fracture, and covering a larger interval using a single treatment.
In some cases where it is impossible to achieve the required high injection rates during a fracture treatment, high pressure or rates can be utilized during the perforation process. Extreme overbalance perforating is the application of a very high overbalance pressure during the perforating process, or the very high pressure surging of existing perforations [Brown et al., 2000; Behrmann et al., 1996]. Pressurized liquid and/or gas (usually nitrogen, N2) is utilized to inject various fl uid systems into the formation. The primary objective is to create hydraulic fractures either as a pre–hydraulic fracture treatment or as a dynamic fl uid diversion [Handren et al., 1993; Dees and Handren, 1993]. Propellant assisted perforating combines perforation breakdown with propellant in a single tool and operation [Loman et al., 1996]. The perforating assembly has a propellant sleeve over a conventional perforating gun assembly. When the guns are detonated, the propellant sleeve is ignited, instantly producing a burst of high–pressure gas. The gas enters the perforations, breaks through any damage around the perforation tunnel, and creates short fractures near the well.
Although the multiple point source strategy can cover as much as approximately 300 ft of reservoir thickness per treatment, this is still not enough to effectively treat the long open hole intervals in EGS with a thickness of more than 1,000 ft in a single treatment. Therefore, this strategy requires multiple treatments separated by bridge plugs or sand plugs, making it a somewhat time-consuming process. In areas where this process is often used, as many as 6 fracture treatments can be performed during a single day. In some areas, up to 15 separate fracture stages are pumped in a single vertical well.
There are several oil industry fracturing technologies that involve the use of coiled tubing. One technique involves pumping the fracture treatments through a coiled tubing string. For this procedure, perforations are shot along the entire well fi rst. Then, a bridge plug–packer assembly run on coiled tubing is used to place proppant into a selective set of perforations [Zemlak et al., 1999]. The assembly is quickly pulled up after a fracture treatment, to conduct the fracture treatment in the next shallower set of perforations. This technique has the advantages that it isolates the wellhead and tubulars from treating pressures, and reduces execution time compared to staged stimulations, although there are more signifi cant limitations to the slurry injection rates and pressures due to the relatively small diameter of the coil. In areas where this process is often used, as many as 20 fracture treatments can be completed during a single day. A second coiled tubing fracture technique involves running a jetting tool on coiled tubing into an unperforated well [Hejl et al., 2006]. Perforations are cut into the casing by fi rst pumping a low concentration proppant slurry through the jetting tool. The propped fracture treatment is then pumped down the casing / coiled tubing annulus. After the fracture treatment is completed, the fractured perf interval is covered with a sand plug to isolate it from the next fracture stage performed up the hole. After all of the fracture treatments are completed, the coiled tubing string is used to clean out the well. As many as 8 fracture stages have been performed per day.",A Hybrid Alternative—Uncemented Slotted Liners in Horizontal Wells,"Reducing cost in the oil industry has shown a tendency in some areas to omit cementing of a horizontal section, because this was often prone to technical diffi culties, e.g. due to the presence of channels at the top of the annulus [Minner et al., 2003; Wright et al., 1996], and stage isolation often failed.
To enable at least some degree of selective fracture treatments or remedial work within the (e.g., horizontal) target zone, the liner has multiple point–source limited entry perforations in the open hole (uncemented) section. Liner perforations are either mechanically installed on the liner before running in the hole, or conventionally shot once the liner is in place downhole. An unrestricted slotted liner does not provide good diversion behind the pipe into the open hole annulus. With the point source perforation strategy, the hope is that the higher local pressure at each perforation cluster initiates a fracture system nearby.
A lateral of signifi cant length can be effectively stimulated using this method in the Barnett Shale [Fisher et al., 2005, 2004; Van Dyke et al., 2005]. However, the location of the created fractures is not strongly correlated to the location of the clusters of perforations. That is, the fracture network grows where in–situ conditions along the horizontal lateral dictate, and not exactly where the perforations are shot along the uncemented liner.
In the Rose Field, a pioneering area for using the uncemented slotted liner concept, surface tilt mapping showed transverse fracture growth at the toe and heel of the well, with a large longitudinal component in the central portion of the lateral [Minner et al., 2003]. Injection rates of 60-75 bbl/min were required to distribute fl uids across the entire lateral.
Uncemented slotted liners are common in geothermal wells that are open to unstable formations. Selective slotting opposite lost-circulation zones has been used, but in-fl ow or out-fl ow points are not only those zones that make themselves known during the drilling process. As in oil and gas wells, annular fl ow behind the liner is common, and it is unlikely that a particular zone in an EGS well could be successfully stimulated through an uncemented slotted liner.
Zonal Isolation and Height Diversion",Challenges—Open Hole Wells,"Wells used in EGS applications most often are completed as an open hole well through the section of interest; the open hole may have a length of 1000 feet or more. The main limitations of open hole wells are: (i) the well is unsupported and may collapse; and (ii) selective fracture treatments or remedial work within the target zone are more diffi cult.
Effective zonal isolation in open hole wells is virtually impossible, but packers for open hole wells are available [Freyer and Huse, 2002]. The packers are confi gured with one large element that can be deformed easily to contact the uneven surface of the drilled hole, yet retain strength and suffi cient integrity to withstand the anticipated differential pressures and temperatures. In applications where treatment pressures stay
below fracturing pressures it may be that open-hole packers could be successful, because the pressure differential across the packer would be more moderate. However, the use of these packers is generally not recommended for fracture treatments, as the fracture system typically initiates along the open hole section, and has a tendency to follow this open hole section along and past the packer. In addition, it is not uncommon that the fracture could initiate at the packer due to the compressive force exerted by the packer on the borehole wall.
To obtain height coverage during a stimulation treatment, diversion is therefore more diffi cult in the open hole. In the following section, we discuss a variety of techniques that are sometimes used to improved fracture height coverage over a thick target zone.
Chemical diversion can be conducted by adding chemicals to fracturing fl uids that temporarily seal the perforations or fractures in an open hole well that accept most fl uid fl ow. Chemical diversion includes: (i) Bridging materials such as rock salt and benzoic acid fl akes, (ii) wax beads, and (iii) foams. Bridging materials (e.g., rock salt, benzoic acid fl akes) are used to bridge in perforations and / or pre–existing fractures [Brown et al., 2000]. They share many of the limitations of ball sealers and sand packs in that they are diffi cult to accurately place and keep in place. Wax beads can be reliably placed in the cooled–down, near– well area during stimulations [Johnson and Brown, 1993]. After completion of the treatment, they melt as the bottom–hole temperature builds up [Johnson and Brown, 1993]. The wax beads need to have a melting point that is less than the bottom hole static temperature, and greater than the surface fl uid temperature [Johnson and Brown, 1993]. The benefi ts of wax beads are [Bell et al., 1993]: (i) They adhere to other wax particles; (ii) they deform under pressure; (iii) they are soluble in produced hydrocarbons fl uids; (iv) they are non–hazardous; (v) they are readily available at low cost; and (vi) wax beads with differing melting points are available for treatments in various thermal environments [Johnson and Brown, 1993]. However, wax beads within blocked–off intervals can loosen or melt during the course of a treatment, and thus act as a source of pressure relief [Johnson and Brown, 1993]. Wax beads have been used for water fracturing open hole wells in naturally fractured chalk formations [Bell et al., 1993].
Foams (e.g., with nitrogen gas) [Logan et al., 1997; Zerhboub et al., 1994] have been used particularly in cases where other diversion techniques are impractical or less effi cient. Foams have the additional advantage of good cleanup with little or no potential for damage to the formation. The ratio of gas to fl uid depends on the bottom hole conditions during the treatment.
Water fracturing with alternating gel slugs [Aud et al., 1994; Hainey et al., 1995] utilizes lower pumping rates combined with higher viscosity fracturing fl uids to minimize the creation of a complex near-wellbore geometry [Elbel and Britt, 2000; Robert and Rossen, 2000]. At the same time, the use of alternating gel slugs can ensure fracture growth in other zones. Very high injection rates are also used (more than 100 bbl/min is not uncommon in horizontal well stimulations) in uncemented slotted liners to maximize zonal coverage of a fracture treatment.
The hydra–jet technique is the creation of closely spaced, undamaged jetted tunnels in open hole wells using a jetting tool at the end of a coiled tubing. Creation of the jetting tunnels is immediately followed by a fracture treatment by switching over from injection though the jet tool alone to slurry injection though the annulus [Gilbert and Greenstreet, 2005; East et al., 2004; Hoch et al., 2003]. The benefi ts of this technique are: (i) reduction of the cost and time of completion; (ii) the creation of fewer fractures, or even only a single dominant fracture plane; and (iii) few near–well connectivity problems between the well and the hydraulic fractures.",Alternative Techniques for Lateral Diversion,"Even if it is possible to effectively stimulate a target zone along the entire height of the well, the created surface area could be insuffi cient for economic heat transfer. A solution to this shortcoming is to create more surface area in a lateral direction away from the main or initially created fracture system, and thus, as shown in Figure 2, to create an extremely complex fracture system as opposed to a simple fracture system.
A more extensive lateral fracture system can be obtained manually through staged fracture treatments in deviated or horizontal wells [Goktas and Ertekin, 2000]. Horizontal wells are generally aligned either along the preferred fracture plane for longitudinal fractures, or perpendicular to the preferred fracture plane for transverse fractures [Elbel and Britt, 2000; Lietard et al., 1996; Pope and Handren, 1992].
Many alternative techniques to enhance lateral diversion utilize some type of alternating of a specifi c parameter that controls fracture growth:
• alternating slurry injection rate;
• alternating gel viscosity;
• alternating proppant stages; and
• alternating pump–ins / shut–ins.
Alternating slurry injection rate and fl uid viscosity can potentially result in switching between mode I (opening mode) and mode II (shearing mode) fracture growth. In particular, fractures may grow along the plane of maximum shear stress at low rates or when injecting fl uids (or gases) with very low viscosity, but perpendicular to the least principal stress at greater rate [Weijers et al., 1999].
Propellant stimulation may also create a more complex fracture network as initiation pressures typically temporarily
exceed all principle stress components. Propellant, which has been used in geothermal wells, is conveyed on wireline and results in improved penetration (versus regular perforating) into the formation and greater connectivity of the reservoir fl uids to the well, and minimizes formation damage during perforating and fracturing. However, the extent of the stimulation is very limited to only tens of feet away from the wellbore, and must therefore be followed with a large size fracture treatment.
Proppant slugs are small volumes of low concentration proppant slurries that are pumped ahead of or during a fracturing treatment [McDaniel et al., 2001a, b; Stadulis, 1995; Cleary et al., 1993]. Their purpose is to screen out multiple–fractures such that they will cease accepting fl uid and propagating. In areas where there is complex fracture growth and natural fractures, such as the Barnett Shale [Van Dyke et al., 2005], proppant slugs are believed to enhance fracture complexity. The proppant slugs can be pumped in various sizes, ranging from the actual proppant used in the treatment to 100–mesh sand.
Alternating proppant stages and the implementation of pump–ins / shut–ins relies on stress shadowing for lateral diversion. Stress shadowing [Warpinski and Branagan, 2001] is the perturbation of the stress in the reservoir due to open hydraulic fractures. The rate at which this stress perturbation declines for an increasing distance away from the face of the fracture is controlled by the smallest areal fracture dimension, i.e., the height or length [Fisher et al., 2004]. The presence of proppant during injection can create a permanent fracture opening on proppant, and shut–in periods between fracture treatments can ensure that this proppant is locked in place to create a stress shadow. Multiple fracture treatment stages in a drill cuttings disposal project [Griffi n et al., 2000] showed that a fan–like fracture system with various fracture orientations can be achieved when fractures are given the time to close on solids between treatments.
These stress shadows have two major impacts [East et al., 2004; Fisher et al., 2004]: (i) The increased compressive stress near a fracture tends to close–off or inhibit the initiation of nearby parallel fractures which provides a diversion mechanism along the well; and (ii) the increase in the magnitude of the local minimum stress tends to encourage fracture growth in orthogonal directions. These two effects are benefi cial for creating extensive and complex fracture networks for EGS. These effects may be more signifi cant if multiple fractures are created from a single well, e.g., transverse fractures from a horizontal well, or fractures intersecting a vertical well at different depths [East et al., 2004]. Stress shadowing has been observed with direct fracture diagnostics in naturally fractured, low permeability reservoirs [East et al., 2004; Fisher et al., 2004]. Stress shadowing can also be used to create height growth barriers by fracturing upper and lower bounding zones before the main hydraulic stimulation or by proppant banking – in particular in water fracturing.
Re–fracture treatments also rely on stress shadowing, as observed by direct fracture diagnostics [Wright and Weijers, 2001; Siebrits et al., 2000; Wright and Conant, 1995]: Re–orientation in re–fracture treatments [Wright et al., 1994a, b] can be caused by changes in the state of stress due to the pres-
ence of open hydraulic fractures or changes in pore pressure distribution in the reservoir. The benefi ts of re–fracturing treatments can be signifi cant, as a new fracture treatment in a previously stimulated well accesses new reservoir if the fracture re–orients perpendicular to the initial fracture direction. In many instances in low permeability reservoirs, this has led to re–fractured wells that produce at almost the initial rate after the fi rst completion, sometimes many years before the re–fracture treatment.",Discussion and Conclusions,"For oilfi eld and EGS reservoirs, stimulation and diversion presents a challenging problem. In terms of stimulation and diversion, the main differences between oilfi eld and EGS are: (i) the volumes injected are a lot greater in EGS, because of the limited nature of the hydrocarbon–bearing strata relative to the presumably much larger target volume for EGS; (ii) in stronger rock for EGS, it is it more diffi cult to benefi t from natural fractures or other pre–existing weaknesses, as compared to weaker rock in the oilfi eld; and (iii) most of the EGS developments have a more or less hydrostatic pressure gradient, in contrast to oilfi eld reservoirs.
Based on the lessons learned from diversion of fl uid fl ow in oil fi eld environments, the following recommendations apply to development of EGS (in order of best expected performance through effective vertical and lateral diversion):
• Deviated / horizontal cased wellbore for excellent control of height and lateral diversion; coiled tubing fracture treatments for quick execution, combined with implementation of alternating rates, gel viscosities, proppant slugs and pump–ins – shut–ins to create stress shadowing for lateral and vertical diversion. A series of directional wells could be used, with the well azimuth in the direction of the least principle stress to maximize the number of active fracture intersections. While transverse fracture systems are effective in draining a large volume of the hydrocarbon reservoir, the rate of heat transfer needs to be balanced with respect to the capacity of the reservoir to prevent the reduction of the heat and fl ow gradients. As in the oilfi eld, horizontal EGS wells would alleviate the problem of inadequate locations at the surface, and maximize the lateral extent of the network of fractures. It may be possible to stimulate through horizontal wells to obtain the largest network but then produce from and inject into vertical wells to maximize heat transfer or inject into vertical wells and produce from horizontal wells. This would be an interesting – but probably costly – way to combine these two technologies.
• Deviated /horizontal uncemented slotted liner with various perforation intervals for limited entry fracturing with single treatment at very high slurry rate, combined with implementation of alternating rates, gel viscosities, proppant slugs and pump–ins – shut–ins to create stress shadowing for lateral diversion. As there is no reliable control of fl uid diversion, some areas along the well may remain unstimulated. To eliminate these unstimulated areas, conducting multiple stimulation treatment stages with fl uid diversion may be
required. While vertical wells will probably yield satisfactory results, the application of uncemented horizontal wells may have advantages for EGS – similar to the advantages observed in oilfi eld applications.
• Horizontal open hole with hydra-jet or propellant initiation strategy, combined with implementation of alternating rates, gel viscosities, proppant slugs and pump–ins – shut–ins to create stress shadowing for lateral diversion. Hydra–jet and propellant assisted initiation aim to achieve fl ow diversion while fl uid contact with the reservoir is not physically restricted by locally pressurizing and thus stimulating only a small target zone. As such, these two techniques may be useful for initiating fracture network stimulations along a long open hole interval in EGS.
Regularly scheduling re–fracture treatments in EGS projects may also be an effective way to continuously stimulate other parts of the reservoir, as the state of stress in the reservoir is changes by placement of proppant, pore pressure and heat transfer changes.
While a number of stimulation and diversion techniques from the oilfi eld can be applied to EGS, the differences between oilfi eld and EGS applications necessitate further study. The overview and discussion presented in this paper is intended as inspiration to discover novel and improved techniques to improve the effectiveness of the development of EGS.",Acknowledgments,We gratefully acknowledge the fi nancial support for the research reported in this paper that has been provided by the Enhanced (Engineered) Geothermal Systems Research and Development Grant (solicitation number DE–PS36– 04GO94001) as part of the Geothermal Technologies Program of the U.S. Department of Energy.

Since that time, exploration, development and monitoring activities have continued, with ongoing collation of geophysical survey and reservoir engineering data, and new geological insights from recent drilling operations. The acquisition of new geoscientific information demands a combined interpretation of the geothermal data sets which can be challenging. As such, 3D modelling has been increasingly used by Contact Energy Ltd. and GNS Science for geothermal data management, analysis and interpretation. To demonstrate the value of 3D modelling and data integration, five 3D geological models of the Ohaaki Geothermal Field have been constructed, for five different stages of field development, using Leapfrog Geothermal 3D visualisation and modelling software. Comparison of the respective 3D models with (historical) interpretations made at each development phase highlights the utility and effectiveness of 3D geological modelling in producing robust and consistent interpretations. We demonstrate how 3D geological models and numerical interpolations can be easily updated and refined, with testing of alternative interpretations accompanying revision of the conceptual and geological models. As a result of increased efficiency and reliability, 3D models can be used on a routine basis to assist in the development of drilling strategies and to advance data integration for field management.",,"C Massiot, G Bignall, S Alcaraz, H van Moerkerk, F Sepulveda, A Rae",,,,,,,,,,,,604378403f2ac7e70170553b_input.pdf,,CRF,,,A.

21 - 23 November 2011 Auckland, New Zealand",1. INTRODUCTION,"The Ohaaki Geothermal Field is located ~30 km NE of Taupo, New Zealand (Figure 1). Exploration drilling began in 1965, following regional electrical resistivity surveys in the Taupo Volcanic Zone (TVZ). Over 45 years of subsequent field exploration and development, 65 wells were drilled for electricity generation and fluid disposal (Figure 2).
Recent field development in New Zealand has used 3D modelling as a routine tool for understanding the 3D geological framework, effectively assisting well planning and field management of geothermal fields. In this paper, we present and assess five 3D geological models developed using the Leapfrog Geothermal software (Carr et al., 2001;
Cowan et al., 2002) at different dates of the development of the field; i.e. after completion of 6, 13, 25, 49 and 65 wells, respectively. The first two models correspond to the state of knowledge during initial exploration, with wells reaching ~800 to 1400 mGL (below ground level). During subsequent field delineation, to ~1971, an additional 12 wells were drilled (i.e. 25 wells completed), with drilled depths in the range of ~1000 to 2500 mGL. The “49 wells model” coincides with the end of production drilling (i.e. includes wells drilled between 1973, and commissioning of the Ohaaki Power Station in 1988). The present steamfield layout comprises 65 wells, and includes make-up wells (particularly in the NW part of the field) drilled since 2001 that support recovery of power generation to ~65 MWe from the Ohaaki Geothermal Field, with several wells drilled to 2500 to 3000 mGL depth.
New Zealand Geothermal Workshop 2011 Proceedings
21 - 23 November 2011 Auckland, New Zealand",2. GEOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK AND DATASET,"The Ohaaki Geothermal Field is composed of a series of sedimentary and volcaniclastic units, and intercalated rhyolite domes and lavas, deposited over a faulted basement (Rae et al., 2007). The stratigraphic sequence to about - 1000 masl (meter above sea level) was initially revealed by wells drilled in the 1960’s, and confirmed by later drilling. It consists of 1) lacustrine deposits (Huka Falls Formation, undifferentiated siltstone), 2) pyroclastic formations (Waiora Formation (re-worked in places), Rautawiri Breccia, Rangitaiki Ignimbrite, Tahorakuri Formation (including Waikora Formation)) and 3) rhyolite/dacite lavas and breccias (Ohaaki Rhyolite, Broadlands Rhyolite, Broadlands Dacite). The basement comprises Torlesse low grade metamorphosed siltstones and sandstones (greywacke).
The geological models presented in this paper are based on the geological interpretation of the 65 wells drilled at the Ohaaki Geothermal Field, in the chronological order of their drilling. The two first models (i.e. 6- and 13-wells) integrate seismic refraction studies performed before the drillings. Results of other geophysical surveys (resistivity, MT and gravity) were also integrated, as well as surface observations and regional geology.",3. OHAAKI AT THE EARLY STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT,"The first model (i.e. after 6-wells completed) of the Ohaaki Geothermal field are based on the stratigraphic sequence determined during the drilling of the wells (Healy, 1968a), and the interpretation of seismic refraction profiles (Banwell et al., 1967), which defined the extent of two intrusions: the Ohaaki Rhyolite and the Broadlands Rhyolite. Discrepancies were observed between the two data sets, which led to a re-intrepretation of the seismic profiles (Mac Donald and Hatherton (1968)). At that stage, the basement has not been reached, and no definite evidence for faulting has been found. The model is therefore composed of sub-horizontal sedimentary and volcaniclastic layers, crossed by two intrusions (Figure 3a).
A cross-section based on this first exploration stage was produced by Healy (1968a), and is in good correspondence
with the 3D-model at the location of the cross-section. Due to the scarcity of data, only few discrepancies could be expected at that stage; however, the 3D model is already a 3D generalisation of the cross-section over the entire field and insures the consistency between all data available.",4. EASY UPDATING OF THE OHAAKI MODEL,,4.1 Refinement of the geological framework,"The first model (6-wells) represented only the postbasement stratigraphy, as the basement has not been reached. In the 13-wells model, only two wells cross the basement in the SE part of the field where it is shallower (Figure 3b). The first wells deeper than -1100 masl were completed near the end of the exploration phase (25-wells model, Figure 3c). The well data reveal lateral thickness variations of the unit overlying the basement. Small variations may be due to the paleo-relief existing at the time of deposition, but major variations are likely to be due to fault displacement, despite no definitive evidence of faulting in the wells, either in redundancy of stratigraphic layers or in the texture of the rocks.
At the 6-wells stage, only two intrusions were encountered by the wells: the Ohaaki Rhyolite and the Broadlands Dacite. The following drillings defined several other major intrusions, such as the Broadlands Rhyolite, and smaller lavas (e.g., the Andesite C). The Ohaaki Rhyolite plays an important role in the permeability of the field, and the presence of a large, broad sheet with two domes has been suggested even before drilling thanks to seismic interpretation. This global frame geometry has been preserved in subsequent stages of development. In the 13- wells model, more wells crossed the rhyolite and geological data are in better agreement with the re-interpreted seismic data set. The major modifications of the shape of the lava in the latter stages concern the eastern extent, which happened to be further to the East and has been accurately defined at the 49-wells stage. Further drilling refined the shape of the

rhyolite, but did not modify it considerably. The latest development phase was focused on the deep NW parts of the field and refined the extent of several lavas (Figure 3e).",4.2 Evolution of the structure of the Ohaaki Geothermal Field,"Geophysical (Gravity and seismic) studies suggested a ~20° deepening of the basement to the NW, without evidence for faulting. However, regional structure trends such as the scarp striking NE-SW marking the edge of the Kaingaroa plateau (to the East of Ohaaki), NE-SW alignment of hot springs and aerial photographs and Bouguer gravity anomalies (Banwell et al., 1967, Mac Donald and Hatherton, 1968) suggest a general structure of the field. At the 6-wells stage, there is no definite evidence of faults, from stratigraphic displacement or texture identification, but the wells did not reach the basement. Volcanic and volcaniclastic deposits mask the deep structure of the field, which makes the role and geometry of faulting in the Ohaaki Geothermal field difficult to frame.
Two of the wells drilled between the 6- and 13-wells stage intersected the basement in the SE part of the field, but did not determine the presence or absence of faults (Figure 4a). It is only from the 25-wells stage that deep faults were identified from major displacement of the top of the basement, crossed by 6 wells (Figure 4b). For example, a deepening of the top of the basement of ~375 m is observed between BR7 and BR16, the latter located ~400 m SE of BR7, therefore incompatible with a deepening of the basement to the NW as indicated in geophysical measurements. At that stage, four fault blocks were discriminated, separated by NE-SW striking faults, the direction inferred from the regional settings.
The next stages of field development involved deep wells, which helped refining the deep structure of the basement by précising the location, orientation and deepening of the faults (Figure 4c and 4d). Most recent field development has occurred in the NW part of the field, with deep wells exceeding 2000 m, which has allowed the basement structure to be defined with more accuracy.
Before the drilling of deep wells, the geophysical measurement provided a general structural trend of the Ohaaki Geothermal Field, but the resolution was not high enough to resolve the complexities of the field, as subsequently revealed by deep drilling. The complexity of the fault network at the current stage (65 wells) is now high, and further drilling may indicate the presence of additional faults with small displacement and/or redefine the location and orientation of existing faults. Resolving such network while integrating geological knowledge and experience without the help of a 3D modeller would be of great difficulty and would lead inevitably to inconsistencies between data through the field.",5 CONCLUSION,"The evolution of the geological and structural framework through the history of the development of the Ohaaki Geothermal Field has been evaluated by five Leapfrog Geothermal 3D geological models. Each of them corresponds to exploration, resource delineation and production drilling phases of the field.
The first stage of exploration presented a simple geometry for the volcano-sedimentary stratigraphic pile, but the incorporation of geophysical data already allowed the delineation of two of the intrusions. Integration of seismic data during the exploration phase provided invaluable information on the geometry of rhyolite bodies, particularly where it could be combined with drillhole data in the 3D model. Further drilling refined this representation, and especially the geometry of the intrusions. Resolving the role and geometry of faulting in the Ohaaki area is not straightforward, in part as faults are buried and have no (or rare) surface expression. The first wells drilled were too shallow to intersect the basement, and it is only at the 25-wells stage that the presence of faults was proven. The fault network has then been refined with subsequent deep drilling, becoming increasingly complex. As more drill-hole data are acquired, 3D modelling provides best means of updating and visualising the structural relationships and geological framework of the field. This reduces the risk involved in targeting formational, inter-formational and fault permeability zones.
3D geological models geological models can highlight incoherencies in source data but also help with calibration processes and interpretation. The implicit modelling technique used by Leapfrog Geothermal is particularly efficient in ensuring consistency within and between data sets; it also provides flexibility to update the 3D model after each new well is drilled (as well as the integration of different data sets, such as well logging, geophysical measurements, and geochemical data). It is also possible to test quickly different interpretation scenarios, by enabling the modeller to develop different models simultaneously. 3D models can be continuously interrogated, providing quickly 3D views, elevation maps, cross-sections or the expected stratigraphy of a planned drill-hole, for efficient well targeting and field management.

Since that time, exploration, development and monitoring activities have continued, with ongoing collation of geophysical survey and reservoir engineering data, and new geological insights from recent drilling operations. The acquisition of new geoscientific information demands a combined interpretation of the geothermal data sets which can be challenging. As such, 3D modelling has been increasingly used by Contact Energy Ltd. and GNS Science for geothermal data management, analysis and interpretation. To demonstrate the value of 3D modelling and data integration, five 3D geological models of the Ohaaki Geothermal Field have been constructed, for five different stages of field development, using Leapfrog Geothermal 3D visualisation and modelling software. Comparison of the respective 3D models with (historical) interpretations made at each development phase highlights the utility and effectiveness of 3D geological modelling in producing robust and consistent interpretations. We demonstrate how 3D geological models and numerical interpolations can be easily updated and refined, with testing of alternative interpretations accompanying revision of the conceptual and geological models. As a result of increased efficiency and reliability, 3D models can be used on a routine basis to assist in the development of drilling strategies and to advance data integration for field management.",PScript5.dll Version 5.2.2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Introduction
The heat energy contained in geothermal fluids can be used everywhere where heat is necessary to complete some process. Of course, this is true if the geothermal fluid has sufficiently high temperature and flow, if not than it can be used only for a part of the process or with additional heating to cover all the heat energy needs of the process. Food industry is a big energy consumer, especially of heat. There is variety of thermal prefabricating processes deal-ing with different kind of food products (fruit, vegetables, grains, sugar, milk, meat, etc.).",1. POSSIBLE FIELD OF USE,"Possible field of use of the low-temperature geothermal energy is very wide (Fig.1). Everywhere where low temperatu-re heat is necessary it can be covered with the one extracted from geothermal brines. Depending on the technical organization of concrete industrial process, use of geothermal energy can be independent or in combination with the heat of other origin (fossil fuels, electricity, bio energy, etc.).
The diagram given in figure 1 shows that generally the temperature range of the food processing is from 38°C up to 93°C, with exception of some processes that require higher temperatures.",2. BASIC FOOD INDUSTRY PROCESSES WITH POTENTIAL APPLICATI-,,ON OF GEOTHERMAL ENERGY,"The temperature range being considered here (below 150°C) is used in
the basic processes of: preheating, washing, peeling and blanching, evaporation and distilling, sterilizing and drying.",2.1. Preheating and heating,"Geothermal energy can be effectively used to preheat boiler and other processfeed water in a wide range of food Industries.
The boiler for feed-water heating has considerable load to pre-heat the feed water coming at typically 10-16 ºC up to the temperature at which it is introduced into the boiler, typically 93-149 ºC, depending on the system.
The geothermal resource can be used to offload the boiler of a part or entire preheating load. A wide variety of industries use water for various processes, large quantities of feed water can be preheated or heated with geothermal energy to the desired temperature.
2.2.Washing
A large amount of low-temperature energy (35-90ºC) is consumed in several food industries for washing and clean-up processes, with major uses in meat processing for scalding; in soft drink production for container and returnable bottle washing (77ºC); in poultry dressing, canning and other food processes.",2.3. Peeling and blanching,"In the typical peeling operation, the product is introduced into a hot bath, which may be caustic, than the skin or outer layer, after softening, is mechanically scrubbed or
- 164 -
washed off. Peeling equipment is continuous-flow type in which the steam or hot water is applied directly to the product
stream or indirectly by heat-ing the product bath. In most instances, product contact time is short.

Blanching operations are similar to peeling. Product is usually introduced into a blancher to inhibit enzyme action, provide product coating, or making the product halfready for cooking. Blanching may be either a continuous or batch operation. Typical blanching fluids require closely controlled properties. Thus, it is unlikely that geothermal fluids could be used directly in blanchers and peelers because of the water quality. Geo-thermal fluids could, however, provide the energy through heat exchangers.
The temperature range for most of the peeling and blanching systems is 77-104 ºC.",2.4. Evaporation and distillation,"Evaporation and distillation are basic operations in many processing plants to aid concentrating a product or separating products by distillation. The source temperature requirements vary with the product being evaporated. However, in a majority of agricultural processes, water is being driven off; and in these cases, operating temperatures of 82-120 ºC are typical. In some circumstances, the evaporators operate at reduced pressures that way decreasing temperature needs and improve product quality.
Evaporators are commonly found in sugar processing, mint distilling and organic liquor processes. Evaporators, depending upon temperature and flow rate requirements, can be readily adapted to geothermal energy as the primary heat source. The energy can be transferred trough secondary heat exchangers to the working fluids or, in some instances, used directly in evaporator, depending upon existing plant designs or adaptations to new plant expansions.",2.5. Sterilizing,"Sterilizers are used extensively in a wide range of food industries and include applications such as equipment sterilization for the canning and bottling industry. Most sterilizers operate at temperatures of 104- 120 ºC and would utilize geothermal energy with the use of heat exchanger potable sterilizer water. Many sterilizers operate in a continuous mode. Equipment wash down and sterilization, however, may occur periodically or at shift changes.
2.6.Drying
Drying of agricultural products, like: rise, vegetables and fruits, grains, sugar and
other, are typical food processing applications of the heat in temperature range between 90-150°C (now-a-days there are also low-temperature drying technologies with temperatures up to 50°C).",3. LOCATION OF HEAT CONSUMERS IN TYPICAL FOODINDUSTRY TECHNOLOGY LINES,"3.1.Agriculture
Agriculture is given separately from the food industry since it produces row food that should be prepared for further processing – fabricating.
Typical heat consumers in agriculture are drying of animal food, fruits and vegetables. For instance, except to use conventional fuels for a rotary-flame furnace (requireing 1000°C), it is possible to apply a forced-air system using a multi-layer conveyor belt with temperatures of about 135°C. In addition, a newer method introduces field wilting in order to reduce initially the moisture content and then the extraction of the reminded one by warm air stream is taking place (80-120°C).
Significant amount of energy is consumed annually for grains, vegetables and fruit drying. Normally, processes can be adopted for the use of temperature ranges between 40-85°C, which is feasible for most of the geothermal resources. The kiln for grains is typically a large vertical vessel with the grain entering at the top. Hot air is forced through the grain, extracting the moisture before being exhausted. In opposite, the kiln for vegetables and fruits is normally a horizontal line, where the product is moved by means of conveyor through the drying room. Hot air is blown below the product line and dries it by passing the product mass.",3.2. Food processing industry,"As already said, the heat consumers in food processing industry can be located in different heat exchangers or consumers for different pre-heating, peeling, blanching, cooking, etc. However, it can be also found that not all of the heat requirements can be covered by the energy of geothermal origin.
For instance, many of the processing methods used by potato processors can utilize energy supplied by 150°C or lower geothermal fluids. Typically, however, a few of the operations, notably the frying operation, will require higher temperatures than

can be provided by a majority of the geo- thermal resources.

Usually, in a potato-processing plant there are potato-product lines and several by-product lines. In a french-fried potatoprocessing line, it can be identified that possible geothermal heat users are the preheater, where potatoes are warmed and peel softened, then for preparation of 15% lye solution for chemical peeling of about 60-80°C, for the blanching and frying at temperature of 190°C. It is obvious that for such a line geothermal energy should be used by means of intermediate heat exchangers. To avoid any possible contamination of the product by the geothermal fluid, or the need for separate treatment of the fluid, the geothermal fluid passing through these heat exchangers will transfer energy to a seconddary fluid (usually water), which delivers the energy to the process. The secondary fluid, circulating in a closed system, then returns to the intermediate heat exchanger to be reheated. For a geothermal fluid at 120- 150°C, all the thermal energy needs for such a line could be met, except for the heating of the fryers.
Sugar processing line is also a typical technology requiring low-grade heat for different parts of the process. For instance, a line for sugar-beet processing, includes the following heat users: diffusion process, juice purification, evaporation, crystallisation and pulp-drying molasses. The diffusers
separate the pulp and raw juice from the long thin strips of sliced beet. The requested temperature of the operation is between 70- 80°C (the rate of diffusion increases directly with temperature). In order to purify the juice, since it contains non-sugar impurities lime in the form of slurry of calcium saccharine is introduced under a temperature of 65-90°C. After the purification, the juice is introduced under a temperature of 65-90°C. After the purification, the juice is heated to 116°C and transported to the evaporators, where the water is taken from the solution. After the evaporation operation, the juice is going to the crystallisers, where boiling takes place at low steam pressure and thus low temperature in order to avoid the caramelization. After that, following one or two brief washes with pure hot water is coming, before discharging the wet white sugar crystals from the central basket. After that it is sent to pass the dryer or granulator and the cooler. Hot, filtered air is passed through the granulator and cool, also filtered air is passed through the cooler. A sideline of this process is the pulp drying. It is made after the pulp leaves the diffusion process.
The sugar processing from different raw materials principally has the same heat users, with some small differences in temperature levels.

Generally, it can be concluded that geothermal waters of about 120°C can cover all the heat requirements, except for the evaporation phase where higher temperatures are required. Different food (vegetable and fruit) processing lines have similar composition of heat users, i.e. with the similar limitations for possibilities to cover heat requirements by means of geothermal fluid application.","In the worldwide practice, the application of geothermal energy, as an alternative energy resource, can be of a great importance. This is especially the case in the countries where exceptional natural geothermal potentials exist.
The major contribution in development of the special technological equipment, required for the utilization of this kind of energy, (e.g. pumps, transportation equipment, chemical treatment of fluid, heat exchangers, etc.), is realized in technologically developed countries, i.e. U.S. and Western European ones.
The industrial application of geothermal energy is at the beginning in Europe. However, the existence of geothermal fields as well as the insufficient resources of conventional energy represents the challenge for further investigations in this field. Quality of geothermal resources that are available in Europe, dictates the use of this type of energy within the low-temperature technological processes. These processes are significantly engaged in different groups of processing industries. Therefore, the expectations for broader engagement of professsional and scientific potentials in various disciplines, is quite legitimate.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6. CONCLUSION,"In this section, stress is not given to the equipment for adjustment of parameters,

and processing apparatuses for implementation of technological processes, because the geothermal system uses the same elements as the convectional one.
- Steam extraction system. Multipletemperature steam heating systems are routinely used in industrial process plants. In geothermal technologies, use of the steam flashed from geothermal fluid has many advantages because heat transfer rates with condensing steam are uniformly high, steam is less susceptible to fouling and as very important, any scaling in the flash step can be controlled by proper design of the flash vessels and by the use of scale-suppressant additives.
The design of an extraction system consists of the following parts: Geothermal fluid from each well is pumped individually to the energy extraction system. Here a scale control additive is put into the brine by a positive displacement pump and mixed in a static mixer. The fluid than flows to the first, second and third vessels where the pressure is reduced to the production required temperatures.
After filtration the liquid is routed to the individual re-injection well where highpressure pumps force the liquid into the receiving strata.
- System for upgrading geothermal fluids. The energy that is available initially from geothermal well is heat, usually in the form of hot water or wet steam. The higherlevel heat should first be extracted and a cascade use can then be accomplished to maximize energy utilization. The industries, such as pulp and paper and chemical industries, probably will require steam at varying pressures. In most cases, the heat is extracted for process use by the following means:
1. Geothermal fluid to process fluid heat exchange; 2. Convert to steam for process heating and for electricity generation; and 3. Convert to a secondary fluid vapour (freon, isobutene, etc) for electricity generation or process heating.
Each of these means that heat transport can have some application in specific processes. Taking into account that steam is the universal process heating media, we will concentrate on designing system supply
process steam at needed pressures by way of compression.
Mechanical compression, although being capital cost intensive, is used for the high-grade energy upgrading the low heat and pressure.
The basic system for upgrading a geothermal fluid for various industrial process pressures has incorporated a flash vessel for the production of steam; a compressor driven by an isobutene turbine; an isobutene condenser, and a heat exchanger to heat and evaporate the condensed isobutene using the geothermal fluid.
5. PLANTS AND INSTALLATION MATERIALS FOR GEOTHERMAL ENERGY APPLICATION
The change of the technological process in old plants, with application of geothermal energy, excludes discussion on plants and installation materials for the use of this energy, because the only thing necessary to be done to supply the plant with geothermal energy is to prepare the geothermal fluid chemically.
Regarding prospective or new plants projects in which geothermal energy is to be introduced, materials corresponding to the water property must be specified in order to avoid corrosion attacks.
High salinity geothermal fluids will cause high uniform corrosion as well as localized corrosion and will severely limit the use of carbon steels. The application of mild steels to geothermal environments requires that precautions should be taken for de-aeration, flow rate, scaling, galvanic coupling, protection of exterior surfaces and steel specifications.
By taking appropriate precautions, carbon steels can be used for thick-walled applications in contact with most geothermal fluids. Thin-walled applications will be limited by the susceptibility of these materials to localized attack, such as pitting and crevice corrosion.
6. OPTIMISATION OF INDUSTRIAL APPLICATION OF GEOTHERMAL ENERGY
Industrial application of geothermal energy have two directions in development: 1. In utilization of existing plants and equipment, and 2. In building new installation and complex
- 170 -
technologies, adapted to the application of this sort of energy. In the first case, optimisation should be used as an instrument for examination of economical advantages in application of geothermal energy, over some classical energy resources. This optimisation is determined both temporal and spatial. Optimisation within the system itself has an aim to examine which of the methods used in application of geothermal energy in existing technological equipment is more feasible.
There are two available methods: 1. Direct application of chemically treated
geothermal fluid, or 2. The application of heat exchangers
using the heat of geothermal fluid for feeding the secondary thermal circuit. Optimisation plans should include certain changes in the technological process in order to enable the application of geothermal energy, utilization of thermal pumps and determination of the maximal energy level within technological process.
Optimisation on the second level should include mathematical analysis of the great number of factors that are decisive in the development of certain industrial technology. The most important among those factors are: the geothermal fluid parameters chemical structure of the fluid, quality and price of the plant and parameters and regimes of the technological process itself.
The equipment for environmental protection is to be mentioned as well.",3.2. Specific elements of geothermal system,"In this section, the general elements of direct application of geothermal energy (listed above) are discussed, from the aspect of industrial use.
- Geothermal well. There are a variety of methods of providing geothermal fluid to an aboveground system. Artesian wells provide surface water naturally and some non-artesian wells can be induced to flow without pumping.
A mechanism by which a non-artesian well can be induced to flow is to reduce the density of the column of liquid in well. For instance, if the liquid is to be mixed with gas, the combined fluid density may be low enough that the down-hole conditions allow the liquid partially flash to steam; the reservoir maintains the low-density liquidvapour mixture in the well.
An important advantage of pumping a self-flowing well is that pressure of the liquid is maintained, so down hole flashing and scaling are minimized. Also, not allowing the fluid to flash, the discharge temperature can be much higher than the surface temperature of a self-flowing well. This is an important consideration when high-temperature geothermal applications are desired.
However, several factors, such as depth of the well, fluid chemistry, temperature and pressure of geothermal fluid, should be considered by the designer in choosing a geothermal well pump.
Important part of the connector to the geothermal well, is the apparatus for degassing.
- Heat exchangers. The principal reason to have heat exchanger in geothermal systems is to confine the geothermal waters with their inherent impurities where corrosion or scaling can either be controlled by material selection or where cleaning will be relatively easy and economical.
It must be remembered that there will be a temperature difference between the primary and secondary fluids any time the heat exchanger is used.
Approach temperatures of less then 6 ºC are often uneconomical but depend on heat-exchanger type and particular application.
The principal types of heat exchangers used in geothermal systems are the downhole heat exchangers; the shell-and tube heat exchanger; the fluidised-bed heat exchanger; the direct-contact heat exchanger, and the plastic-tube heat exchanger.
The down-hole heat exchanger eliminates the problem of disposal of geothermal fluid, since only heat is taken from the well. The exchanger consists of a system of pipes or tubes suspended in the well through which clean secondary water is pumped or allowed to circulate by natural convection.
The interaction between the fluid and aquifer and the one in the well is not fully understood, but it appears that outputs are higher when there is a high degree of mixing, indicating that somewhat permeable formations are preferred.",3.1. General elements of geothermal systems,"The technology composition for geothermal system function for industrial uses can be divided in two main parts.
The first part includes the general elements of geothermal systems and these are: geothermal well, connector to the geothermal well or a net of distribution, fluid transportation pipes, equipment for chemical treatment of water and apparatus of heat exchangers.
The second part is consisted of elements specific for the industrial application of geothermal energy and they are as follows: - Steam extraction system, - System for upgrading geothermal fluids, - Equipment for adjustment of parameters
(pressure, temperature and flow), - Processing apparatuses for implemen-
tation of technological processes.",4.

INTRODUCTION,"Laying to the south of the Australian mainland, the island of Tasmania has a long history of mineral exploration and development but has only recently been considered as a target for geothermal exploration. Exposures of Devonianaged granite in the far north-east of the state are known to include highly-fractionated high-heat-producing (HHP) granites as part of three major suites (Figure 1; Burrett & Martin 1989). Legacy surface heat flow measurements associated with these rocks at Storey’s Creek and Coles Bay are high (over 90mWm-2) (Jaeger & Sass, 1963; Cull, 1991) and correspond to an average heat production in the granites of ~8µWm-2 (Goh, 2008).
To the south and west of this area, the exposed granite plunges beneath cover containing extensive dolerite, shale, silt and coal formations which potentially provide the insulation necessary for a classic Hot Dry Rock or Enhanced Geothermal System (EGS) target. Complicating this picture is the presence of a known electrical conductivity anomaly observed in the northern Tamar Valley area and referred to as the Tamar Conductivity Zone (TCZ) (Figure 1; Hermanto, 1990). Although initially relatively poorly defined, the TCZ was interpreted an indicator of fluid in fractured permeable zones (Hermanto, 1990). Intersection between the TCZ and buried HHP granites may thus imply the presence of an existing fracture-permeable geothermal system in Eastern Tasmania.
In 2007 KUTh Energy Limited commenced a systematic geothermal exploration program across its tenement area in Eastern Tasmania (Figure 1) with the aim of evaluating the
apparent geothermal potential of this region. The initial program phase, which was designed to identify local targets for future geothermal development, is now nearing completion and has yielded a variety of results with implications not just for geothermal potential but also for the broader geological understanding of this area.",2. REGIONAL GEOLOGY,"Tasmania is divided into two basement terrains located in the west and east of the State (Figure 1). Distinguished by age, lithology and deformation these two regions are ‘believed to have been juxtaposed at a NNW trending dislocation’ inferred to coincide with the Tamar Valley region in central Tasmania (Burrett & Martin, 1989). The Western Terrain comprises variably deformed and metamorphosed Pre-Cambrian basement on which was deposited the now-deformed Cambrian volcanics and sediments of the Dundas Trough and Mt Read Volcanic Belt and the Ordovician-Silurian shelf sediments of the Wurrawina Supergroup. In the East, deformed low-grade
meta-sediments of the Ordovician – Devonian Mathinna Supergroup comprise deep water turbidite deposits that are analogous to the ubiquitous Tasminide flysch of mainland eastern Australia. Both Western and Eastern Terrains are host to Devonian granite, the most extensive intrusions being the slightly older batholiths in the East (Burrett & Martin, 1989).
Across much of the state, basement is concealed by up to 1km of flat-lying Permian-Triassic sediments of the Tasmania Basin and the extensive thick (>300m) Jurassic dolerite sills which intruded these during Gondwana breakup. Mesozoic cover totally obscures the contact between the Pre-Cambrian Western and Palaeozoic Eastern terrains. The nature and location of this feature, which may coincide in part with the TCZ, remains contentious (Burrett & Martin, 1989; Rawlinson et al., 2007; Reed 2001). Similarities in the deformation and depositional style of the Mathinna Supergroup and mainland Tasminide units has led to numerous attempts to correlate the two, the Mathinna being compared variably to the Melbourne Trough and Tabberabbera Zone of central and eastern Victoria (Powell & Baillie, 1992; Reed, 2001).",3. EXPLORATION METHODOLOGY & RESULTS,"Thick Jurassic Dolerite sequences cover much of the surface of Eastern Tasmania and complicate the exploration process by obscuring the geology at depth. Standard geophysical techniques such as aeromagnetic data acquisition are not able to provide interpretable information beneath this layer, which is strongly magnetized. Whilst seismic data acquisition through the dolerite is possible it has not been widely applied in the area of interest and, where available, is of relatively poor quality. Likewise, relatively few drill holes have been sunk through the dolerite, the thickness and apparent lack of mineralization in the unit precluding previous exploratory work.
To effectively explore this region for its geothermal potential a variety of techniques were required that were capable of discerning key elements of the EGS target beneath the dolerite cover. Critical amongst these were the magnitude and distribution of heat flow, the depth of insulator (depth to top granite), the quality (thermal properties) of the insulator and the location and nature of the TCZ. The size of the area under investigation further necessitated that any technique used should be economically applicable at a regional scale. To meet these needs, a program was devised that comprised shallow drilling for surface heat flow determination, gravity interpretation, rock property determination and MagnetoTelluric (MT) data acquisition.",3.1 Surface Heat Flow Determination,"A program of pattern drilling of shallow boreholes was designed to investigate surface heat flow across the tenement area. Holes were drilled on a 20km grid spacing at 36 locations. In all cases the holes were percussion drilled to 100m with diamond core cut to total depth at ~250m. Precision temperature logs were recorded down hole at least twice in the months after drilling to ensure that thermal relaxation was complete. Thermal conductivity values were determined on core samples using a divided bar apparatus. Surface heat flow was determined for each hole by application of 1D thermal modeling.
At the time of writing, surface heat flow data were available for 31 holes with five holes still outstanding (Figure 2). Heat flows determined to date are of high quality and
reliability with analytical uncertainties typically <5%. The data are spatially consistent, defining a large area (>4100km2) of anomalously high heat flow (>90mWm-2) in the central portion of the tenement area.",3.2 Gravity Interpretation,Estimation of the depth to top granitoid was undertaken by Dr. David Leaman using source modeling of gravity data and following the method of Leaman and Richardson (2003). An infill survey of ~500 gravity stations was undertaken to improve the regional gravity coverage across the tenement area. These data were used to create an updated version of the Tasmanian mantle source model MANTLE07. This model was in turn used to determine the residual Bouguer gravity anomaly from which the depth and shape of top granitoid was interpreted (Figure 3).,3.3 Rock Property Determination,"Rock units predicted to overlie the granites in significant thicknesses are the Jurassic Dolerite, the Tasmania Basin sediments (Parmeener Supergroup) and the Mathinna Supergroup. Thermal conductivity values determined from these rocks by divided bar analysis from KUTh drill core are summarized in Table 1 together with data from an independent study of this region (H. Goh, 2008). These results confirm the relatively good insulating properties of
both the Dolerite and the Tasmania Basin sediments. Predictably, the turbidite sequences of the Mathinna Supergroup display variable thermal conductivities, depending upon rock type and grainsize. Of particular interest in these units, however, was the observation of a strong anisotropy associated with the development of fold axial cleavage (Figure 4). This effect, which was observed most strongly in fine-grained mudstone and shale, serves to significantly reduce the insulating advantage of the finegrained lithologies wherever heat flow is directed along the cleavage plane.",3.4 Magneto-Telluric Survey,"An MT survey, comprising 96 stations located at 1km intervals along two E-W lines, was undertaken to better constrain the nature and location of the TCZ anomaly (Figure 5). Full tensor time series data were collected for ~12 hours at each site to ensure resolution of apparent resistivity and phase data in the range 300-0.01Hz.
2D modeling of data generated by this survey was performed by Dr Adele Manzella of the Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche-Istituto di Geoscienze e Georisorse (CNR-IGG) in Italy. Data were found to be of high quality with relatively few incidences of major signal noise. As part of the modeling Dr Manzella applied a
systematic process of data validation to identify, correct or remove poor or biased data. A manually derived ‘static shift’ correction was applied to compensate for distortion effects produced in the electromagnetic field by nearsurface features.
The 2D models produced by Dr Manzella for this survey are presented in Figure 5. In both cases these models have been refined by the use of a priori constraints regarding the location of resistive bodies determined in 1D inversion models. No assumptions were made regarding the location, size or intensity of electrically conductive anomalies or of the nature or distribution of the existing geology. Comparisons of TE, TM and joint TE-TM inversion models for the two lines indicated a good agreement for the northern line whilst the southern line displayed significant differences indicating these data are influenced by 3D effects.
The models derived from the MT data indicate the presence of large electrically conductive bodies within the crust in the vicinity of both survey lines. In the northern profile, a strong east-dipping conductive body is observed at a depth of 2.5km and is interpreted to have a thickness of no less than 2km. This body, together with a weaker west-dipping conductor, confirms the presence of the ‘Tamar Conductivity Zone’ (TCZ) in this region.
An east-dipping electrically-conductive anomaly is also identified at the western end of the southern MT profile at a depth of 3.5 - 4km. This body lies directly along strike from the east-dipping feature identified in the northern profile and is interpreted to be an extension of the TCZ along the Tamar Lineament (Figure 6).
An electrically insulating anomaly is seen located to the east of the interpreted east-dipping TCZ anomaly in both the northern and southern profiles. At present the identity of the geological feature causing this anomaly remains speculative.
DISCUSSION
Collation of new and existing data for Eastern Tasmania indicates the presence of a significant thermal anomaly in the centre of this region (Figure 6). A large area of elevated heat flow (~4100km2 >90mWm-2) is seen to spatially coincide with the predicted extension of known granite bodies 3-4km under cover. Flat-lying Mesozoic cover sequences of the Tasmania Basin and intrusive Jurassic Dolerite sills provide up to 1km of good insulating cover at surface. Beneath these lie the deformed flysch of the Paleaeozoic Mathinna Supergroup, the insulating qualities of which have been shown to depend upon the orientation of its structural grain. Evidence from field mapping in the north-east indicates that the Mathinna comprises an older
recumbently folded unit in the West which is juxtaposed against younger upright folded sequences in the East (Powell et al., 1993). Recent data suggests that the contact between these units is faulted implying that the older strata may occur at depth in the east (Reed, 2001; D. Seymour pers. comm.). This in turn suggests that the Mathinna section at depth will contain a mixture of upright and horizontal foliations and is therefore likely to be a moderate to good thermal insulator. Combined, these data confirm the potential of this area as a Hot Rock or EGS development target. Further geothermal modeling work to estimate a thermal resource and predict temperature distribution with depth in this area is now underway.
MT survey work has confirmed the existence of the Tamar Conductivity Zone in the north and increased its known extent into the south where it remains open along strike from an area of very high heat flow (>100mWm-2). Whilst the nature of this feature is not uniquely defined, its geometry and location suggest that it is a crustal scale structure, most likely a fault or fracture system. It is plausible that this system may be permeable, containing electrically conductive fluid and/or hydrothermal alteration minerals. The possibility of a southern extension of this feature, and of its relationship to the area of very high heat flow, remains open. Further MT survey work is currently in progress to address these issues by better defining the 3D conductivity structure of the southern region.
The identification of possible crustal-scale structures in the vicinity of the Tamar Valley may also be significant to the interpretation of the overall crustal architecture of Tasmania. There is a strong spatial coincidence between the eastern conductive zone of the TCZ and a crustal-scale boundary identified in velocity structure models from local teleseismic tomography data (Rawlinson et al., 2006). This feature, which juxtaposes high P wave velocities in the West with relatively low velocities in the East, is interpreted as evidence that, unlike the West, the Eastern Tasmania terrain may be underlain by dense rocks with an oceanic affinity (Rawlinson et al., 2006). These data are supported by offshore seismic transects which suggest both a significant change in the character of the crust beneath north-eastern Tasmania and identify the presence of major east-dipping structures in this region (Drummond et al., 2000; MRT, 2003). The TCZ may thus represent the uppermost expression of a boundary between the Eastern and Western Tasmania Terrains.
Viewing the TCZ from the perspective of a crustal terrain boundary it is interesting to examine similarities between it and analogous major crustal boundaries of the Lachlan Fold Belt on the mainland. Reed (2001) concluded from surface mapping work that the Mathinna Supergroup was correlated to the Tabberabbera Zone in eastern Victoria and compared the contact between the Western and Eastern Tasmanian Terrains to the Mt Wellington - Governor Fault system. Assuming that the conductive MT anomalies represent
fracture zones, the geometry of the TCZ, with converging west- and east-dipping structures, is similar to that observed in the Mt Wellington-Governor Fault system (Foster & Gray, 2000). Correlation of these two features remains speculative, however, and further data on the deep crustal relationships in this region, including evidence for a major west-dipping structure, is required.
CONCLUSIONS
A program of systematic geothermal exploration undertaken across Eastern Tasmania has identified a significant new geothermal province. A broad area of anomalously high heat flow (>90mWm-2) is found to spatially coincides with high-heat-producing granite at depth beneath insulating cover. Hot Rock or EGS targets in this area may be further enhanced by the potential for in situ fracture permeability associated with the Tamar Conductivity Zone. This feature, which has been detected by an MT geophysical survey and which may represent a major crustal terrain boundary, remains open along strike from an area of very high heat flow (>100mWm-2). These targets will be further delineated by exploratory work as part of KUTh Energy’s ongoing Tasmanian work program.",ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS,"The authors acknowledge the work of Hot Dry Rocks Pty Ltd, who performed the geothermometry and heat flow modeling for SEL 26/2005 and SEL 45/2007, and Shane Evans of Moombarriga Geosciences, for his work on the MT data acquisition.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Geology and Mineral Resources of Tasmania,,C.F.

The Geothermal Working Group proposed that the national Geothermal Research Centre to be established to be responsible for the national geothermal energy development programme.",1. INTRODUCTION,"More than 90 hot springs with surface temperature ranging from 400 to 1000
C are scattered throughout the country (Fig. 1). These geothermal areas are evidently associated with granitic rocks of various ages and major faults nearby. Most of them are manifested by hot pools and seepages although some are by hot springs and geysers. Although a number of hot springs are found in other rocks, their geographic positions are never located far beyond 25 km from granitic plutons (Ratanasthien and others, 1985). It has also been suggested that these associations limit the areas of high density as well as high potential geothermal resources to northern Thailand (Fig. 2) where almost half of the total area is covered by granites and related rocks.
Many geothermal systems are commonly characterized by hot-water dominated type with sodium bicarbonate species and small amounts of dissolved solids. Chemical composition of the hot spring waters from northern Thailand have been compiled by Praserdvigai (1997). The association
with granitic rocks which influences the chemical composition of the water does not, however, imply whether the water was heated up by steam and gas from hydrothermal fluids, or by long-term heat transfer produced from chemical reactions, fault movements, or radioactive disintegration.
Available isotopic and geological information point out that the thermal waters of most, if not all, geothermal systems in northern Thailand are formed by meteoric water recharged at higher elevations in the vicinity of the hot spring areas (Ramingwong and others, 1980; Takashima and Jarach, 1987; Tunsakul, 1987; and Ratanasthien and others 1987). The cold meteoric water circulates down to some depth, acquires heat and then rises up to the surface. Chemical and isotopic data, however, indicate the absence of mixing between cold groundwater and the uprising thermal water even at shallow depth (Asnachinda and others, 1997). Takashima and Jarach (1987) believed that the period of the meteoric water circulation in a geothermal system of northern Thailand is probably over 100 years. They also suggested that the water is confined within a channel-like reservoirs which provide a large cumulative water to rock ratio. Such geothermal reservoirs may occur hypothetically at depth greater than 1000 m which may not be exploited economically. However, recent geothermal energy exploration results indicate the existence of potentially shallow reservoir at depth less than 200 m.
The preliminary results from reconnaissance surveys which had been done by the National Energy Administration (NEA) of Thailand and Kingston Reynolds Thom & Allardice Ltd. of New Zealand in 1973 indicated that utilization of geothermal energy for power generation and agricultural application was warranted. Contemporaneously, a multi-disciplinary working group, Thailand Geothermal Working Group, consisting of personnel from the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT), the Department of Mineral Resources (DMR), Department of Energy Development and Promotion (DEDP)and Chiang Mai University (CMU) was formed with the aim to define the potential of geothermal development for power generating. The tentative schedule for geothermal energy development in northern Thailand was set up and implemented. Since 1979 the working group has
investigated more than 30 well known hot springs of northern Thailand although the exploration drilling had not begun until 1981 (Table 1). The exploration has subsequently been narrowed down to the five most promising areas, namely Fang, San Kampaeng, Pa Pae, Mae Chaem and Mae Chan where reservoir temperatures estimated from chemical geothermometers are close to or above 1800 C
2. STATUS OF ON-GOING GEOTHERMAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS
Since most geothermal reservoirs in northern Thailand are probably of channel-like shape closely associated with highly-dipping faults or fault sets (MacDonald and others, 1977; Ramingwong and others, 1980; and Takashima and Jarach, 1987) then tracing such narrow fracture reservoirs by deep vertical drilling is a difficult task and too expensive to afford the risk of missing the target. In addition, data from the well-investigated medium enthalpy geothermal fields such as Fang indicate the presence of relatively shallow fractured reservoirs which could be large if developed in the granitic terrain. Therefore, instead of exploiting the deep geothermal reservoirs, the Geothermal Working Group then suggested a possibility of utilizing hot water having temperatures of more than 100 0 C from relatively shallow reservoirs at a depth less than 500 m.",2.1 Fang Geothermal System,"Since December 1989 the EGAT has successfully produced hot water from three shallow wells (150 m depth) at Fang geothermal prospect at a rate of about 60 t/hr (1200C inlet temperature). This thermal energy is use to generate electricity in a 0.3 MWe ORMAT plant (85-90 % availability factor). In 1990 the Fang deep geothermal development project was started under technical cooperation with the French Environment and Energy Development Agency (ADEME). The aim of this collaborative project was to define the potential of the deep reservoir and its controlling structure through detailed geological, geochemical and electrical surveys. Three intermediate depth wells, FX-1, FX-2, FX-3 and FX-4, were drilled during 1992-1994. Only well FX-2 and FX-4 are productive. The well FX-2 encountered a fracture at 270 m depth and produced 25 t/hr of water as hot as 125 0 C. Well FX-4 whose bottom hole temperature is 130 0 C encountered fractures at depth of 268, 337, and 417 m. This well produces hot water at a flow rate of 36t/hr. It should be noted also that the non-productive wells, FX-1 and FX-3, have bottom temperatures of 108 0 C and 1130 C respectively. Since the end of 1996, the well FX-4 has been connected to the hot water system to increase the volume of hot water for the power plant.
Apart from generating electricity from geothermal energy EGAT also implemented an air conditioning cold storage and crop dryer using exhausted hot
water (800 C) from the power plant to demonstrate the downstream utilization for local people (Fig. 3). Recently the King’s Project has constructed a new larger crop dryer using the geothermal heat source to preserve agricultural produce. Meanwhile, the Mae Fang National Park constructed a public bathing pond and a sauna room to serve visitors. The utilization of geothermal energy is said to be successful and is well known as a first “multipurpose geothermal energy development project” in Thailand which can be applied to other geothermal resources. Production cost analysis of Fang binary cycle power plant is presented in Table 2 .",2.2 San Kampaeng Geothermal System,"The San Kampaeng geothermal development project has been conducted under technical collaboration between EGAT and JICA (Japan International Cooperation Agency) since late 1981. The objective of this collaboration was to define the geothermal potential of the area. Exploration holes were drilled during 1982-1989. Two deep exploration wells, GTE-7 and GTE-8, 1227 and 1300 m depths, were completed in 1989. These wells failed to provide enough data to evaluate the reservoirs. Only well GTE-8 encountered fracture zones at various depths from 330-920 m., and only the last fracture at depth of 920 m., discharged 40 t/hr. of water at 1250 C. The project was postponed after the deep drilling did not strike the expected high enthalpy reservoirs.
Unlike Fang’s situation, the geothermal energy at San Kampaeng field was not successfully developed although the estimated resource potential is up to 5 MWe. Its utilization for electricity generation is still not feasible due to lack of available cooling water in the area. At the moment, however, the available hot water from the exploration wells is being used for tourism promotion and bathing. Research work for direct use, such as tobacco curing and ground nut drying (Sithipong and others, 1986), was also carried out to determine reliability of geothermal exploitation on a commercial scale.",2.3 Pai Geothermal System,"Recently EGAT has planned to develop the shallow reservoirs of the Pai geothermal area in Pai District, Mae Hong Son Province, as a multi-purpose project similar to that of Fang. A pre-feasibility study of Pai geothermal area at Ban Muang Rae and Ban Muang Paeng sites was implemented during 1994-1995 under the cooperation of EGAT and CMU. The resource assessment step consisted of geological mapping and hydrogeochemical investigations (Asnachinda and others, 1994). The geological study showed that both sites are situated within a centre of granitic terrain and have structural settings similar to those of Fang area. The Na-K-Ca and silica geothermometers indicated subsurface temperatures of around 140-1800C. Resistivity surveys using the ‘combined head-on’ resistivity method, were conducted at both sites,
and covered an area of about 0.5 sq.km each. The resistivity results showed that low resistivity anomalies conformed with the main faults of the two areas. Ten shallow temperature gradient wells of 50 m depth at the Ban Muang Rae site were completed by EGAT in May 1994. This temperature gradient confirmed that a thermal anomaly extended down to 50 m for at least 500 m along the Pai River in the area of natural discharge. Three 200 m exploration wells, drilled in 1995, were nonproductive. For the Ban Muang Paeng site, four shallow exploration/production wells (MPE1-4) of 250 m depth were drilled from the beginning of 1996 until April 1996. Wells MPE1, MPE3 and MPE4 discharged hot water and had a bottom hole temperature of 940 C. The other well, MPE2, was non-productive and had bottom hole temperature of 92 0 C. The results indicate that the total flow rate was about 25 L/sec. from MPE3 and MPE4 with more or less atmospheric pressure. Due to the survey result showing low potential resource, EGAT decided to postpone the development of this geothermal area for electricity generation owing to the low temperature of the hot water. However, this hot water can still be used for agricultural purposes.",2.4 Other Systems,"In 1982, the Department of Energy Development and Promotion (DEDP) in cooperation with CMU had carried out the detail study in Ban Nam Ron, Ban Phu Toei, Ban Phu Kham and Ban Wang Kham geothermal areas in Petchabun Province to define potential of these low enthalpy geothermal systems. The exploration work consisted of geological, geochemical and resistivity surveys.
During 1983-1986, the DMR established a geothemal project to evaluate the potential of 50 geothermal areas in northern Thailand using geological and geochemical prospecting criteria, A technical assistance from UNDP under the contract of TCD CON 32/83 was included in this project. The UNDP project covered 9 selected geothermal areas namely: Ban Pong, Ban Nong Krok, Pong Kum, Tepanom, Nam Mae Mon, Nam Mae Hull, Ban Sop Pong, Ban Pong Nam Ron and Ban Mae Chok geothermal areas. The expert mission from Geothermica Italiana Srl., Italy, came to carry out field work during 1983-1984. The geophysical and borehole data which were available on some geothermal areas were also used for evaluating the project.
During 1992-1995, DEDP established a five years geothermal exploration plan in order to exploit hot water from shallow wells for small scale agroindustrial application especially in crop drying. The extensive plan to estimate the actual potential of the prospect was commenced in 1993. The resistivity surveys were carried out covering the prospecting area in order to locate and delineate the resistivity structure and then some shallow exploration wells were drilled at the selected
location to examine the subsurface condition. During 1994-1996, nine geothermal areas namely : Mae Chan, Tepanom, Muang Ngam, Pha Bong, Nong Haeng, Mae Kasa, Pong Pu Fuang, Ko Kha, and Pha Sert geothermal areas were investigated as shown in Table 2.
The Mae Chan prospect with surface temperature ranging between 54 - 980 C at Mae Chan District, Chiang Rai Province is now under detailed investigation by the DEDP. The main objective of this programme is to exploit hot water from shallow depth (less than 100 m) for non-electrical purposes especially in crop drying. Field investigation has been carried out by resistivity survey and followed by drilling two 100 m depth shallow exploration wells (PR1 and PR2) at locations suggested by the geophysical results. Of the two wells, well PR2 is the successful hole in checking the inferred fracture. A jet of hot water blows spontaneously at a rate of 5.94 L/sec. to a height of approximately 15 m above the ground. According to Manoonvoravong and Veerapun (1996) a down hole temperature profile of well PR2 shows rapid increase from 870 to 1220 C over 0-9 m depth. A break in the temperature curve at 57 m depth is thought to be due the presence of fractures as postulated by a combined head-on resistivity profile.
Since the beginning of 1997 EGAT and CMU have carried out geochemical and resistivity surveys at Muang Ngam and also at Mae Chan geothermal areas. Shallow exploration drilling was planned to commence at Mae Chan by EGAT in the mid of 1997.",3. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS,"Recently, the Thai Geothermal Working Group has participated a regional collaborative project funded by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) which consits of other three participating countries namely: China, Indonesia, and the Philippines. The 3-year project entitled “Regional Collaboration in East Asia and the Pacific for the Development of Geothermal Energy Resources and Environmental Management through Isotope Techniques” started on January 1997. Its general objective is to support the utilization of geothermal energy resources for electrical and non-electrical applications in the east Asia and the Pacific through applications of isotopes and geochemical techniques towards their practical use as an indispensable well established tool for geothermal reservoir management.
The collaborative activities in which the Working Group are responsible for include : 1.) The investigation of Fang geothermal system under the assigned sub-project entitled “Investigation of hydrology of the Fang geothermal system by isotope and chemical tools”. About 40 water samples have been analysed for their isotopic composition by the IAEA laboratory in Vienna. A
progress report of this investigation submitted to the Agency in May 1999 as a part of its on-the-job training in Isotope Hydrology and Geochistry held at Leyte, the Philippines (see Asnachinda and others, 1999). It is hope that the outcome of this research project will promote a sustainable development of Fang geothermal resources for electric and direct-use of the hot water. 2.) Interlaboratory comparison of isotope (excluding Thailand) and chemical results to ensure the quality of chemical analyses in the region will be organized under the coordination of the IAEA. Two sets of water samples collected from high and low enthalpy hot springs will be shipped to the geochemical laboratories of CMU and DMR later this year. This comparison will be undertaken once a year for the duration of the regional collaboration. 3.) A contribution of Thailand’s geothermal water data to the Regional Database on Geothermal Waters administered by China (East China Geological Institute). This database is definitely essential for planning and management of the geothermal resources in this region. The participating countries agreed to submit the data to China every six months. Consequently, the updates will be submitted to participating countries once a year or as requested. 4.) The Working Group also hosted a technical meeting at Chiang Mai in August 1998 whereas the Philippines and Indonesia are responsible of the 1997 and 1999 meeting respectively.
Although Thailand is the first country of the Southeast Asian region to operate a binary cycle geothermal power plant, the national programme on geothermal energy development still has not been firmly established. The major problems facing the development plan i.e. personnel, administration and budget, has not yet been solved. Technical personnel involved are mainly from related fields with no specialized training. Administration of the projects are not properly organized and with no definite designated responsibilities. Research and development budget are not in continuity.
The Thai Geothermal Working Group, at the meeting on 6 September 1996 at Chiang Mai University, have unanimously agreed to submit a proposal to the Sub-committee on Renewable Energy Research and Development, National Research Council, to establish and fund Thailand Geothermal Research Centre (TGRC), Chiang Mai University, with budget of 2.5 million baht (66,000 US$), annually. The full proposal is shown here as Appendix. For the outputs of the TGRC, it is anticipated that the geothermal research and development activities of the country will be effectively carried out and proceeded at internationally standard. Potential indigenous geothermal resources will be effectively developed and exploited.
4. CONCLUSION
Geothermal energy development in Thailand is still in progress as evidenced by continuous exploration and research activities of the organizations concerned. The Fang project is a good example for other projects because it has already shown that the development of geothermal energy is very competitive, even on a small scale. The problems being faced now are lack of skill personnel, lack technology know-how and lack of budget. The Thai Geothermal Working Group has submitted a proposal to the Sub-committee on Renewable Energy Research and Development, National Research Council, to establish and fund Thailand Geothermal Research Centre (TGRC), Chiang Mai University, with budget of 2.5 million baht (66,000 US$), annually. Through a proper administration by this centre it is expected that the potential indigenous geothermal resources will be effectively developed and exploited.",ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS,"The authors, on behalf of the Goethermal Working Group of Thailand, wish to express their sincere thanks to the National Research Council of Thailand and the International Atomic Energy Agency for their kind persistent support.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cold water inflow in shallow geothermal systems of northern Thailand.

GEOTHERMAL RESOURCES
As a product of the subduction of the Cocos plate beneath the Caribbean plate, Costa Rica is a volcanically active region. Hot springs are very prevalent in the central part of the country. Systematic geothermal exploration has yet to be done in Costa Rica. Until a systematic reconnaissance is conducted, there is no estimate of the country's geothermal potential. Los Alamos geologists are likely to start soon a reconnaissance program financed by AID.
Geothermal energy has been of interest in Costa Rica since 1959, when preliminary nationwide inventories of thermal manifestations were made. Subsequent visits by United Nations geothermal experts indicated the importance of detailed exploration in the thermal areas of the volcanic Guanacaste Range. Between 1964 and 1974, however, no specific effort was made toward geothermal development.
Interest in geothermal development was renewed in 1975 and a regional assessment was begun in the area surrounding the Miravalles, Ricon de la Vieja, and Santa Maria volcanoes. Based on a prefeasibility study funded with InterAmerican Development Bank (IDB) assistance, Miravalles was targeted as the most promising area.

The Las Hornillas de Miravalles geothermal area is located within the
Guanacaste geothermal province. The Guanacaste area is characterized by a line of surface thermal features, 30 km in length, occurring along the flank of an active volcanic chain. As recommended by the reconnaissance studies, three wells were drilled into the 2400C reservoir. Production drilling began at Miravalles in 1979 and continued through 1980 with the completion of three wells to depths of 1200 to 1300 m.
A new drilling program was initiated in March 1984 aimed at drilling 5 to
6 deep wells. The new drilling program was advised by Electroconsult of Italy and funded by IDB. This drilling led to a 23 MWe single-flash or a 32 MWe double-flash wellhead potential. It is projected that a power generating station of 55 MWe single-flash well be on-line by 1990. A second power plant is tentatively scheduled for 1994.
In addition to the areas mentioned, preliminary studies have indicated
that 54 localities may hold geothermal potential. Many of these areas possess moderate-temperature resources and therefore, may be attractive for binary electric generation technology. Other areas that have been explored in the Guanacaste region include Las Pailas, Salitral, and Boringuen where geochemistry has indicated high (2400C) subsurface temperatures.
The Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad (ICE) is the agency within the
country that began planning for geothermal development. To date only Miravalles has undergone feasibility studies but prefeasibility studies have been performed at Pailas-Rincon de la Viega. Other fields have been identified but not assessed.

Because of this cost differential, it is desirable to use slim holes for geothermal reservoir assessment. Production and injection data from slim holes and large-diameter wells at five geothermal fields (Oguni, Sumikawa, Takigami, and Kirishima, Japan; Steamboat Hills, U.S.A.) were examined to establish relationships (1) between productivity and injectivity indices, and (2) between discharge capacity of slim holes and large diameter wells.

INTRODUCTION,"The utilization of slim holes in the exploration for and assessment of geothermal resources can drastically change the economics of a geothermal utilization project by lowering the initial cost associated with the project. A major impediment to the exploration for and assessment of new geothermal resource areas worldwide is the high cost of conventional rotary drilling. A conventional 1500-2000 m deep rotarydrilled geothermal well can cost millions of dollars. Compared to conventional geothermal wells, the drilling costs for slim holes (diameter < 150 mm) can be less than 60% of the total cost of a large-diameter well (Combs and Goranson, 1995). In addition, the success rate for geothermal exploration (wildcat) wells is only 25-40%. Because of the low success rate for geothermal wildcat wells and the aforementioned cost differential, in addition to the reduced environmental impact, it is desirable to use slim holes for geothermal exploration and reservoir assessment (Finger, et al, 1995; 1997).
In order to establish the utility of slim holes for definitive reservoir assessment, it is necessary to be able to predict the discharge characteristics of large-diameter wells based on discharge and/or injection tests on small-diameter boreholes. To compute the probable discharge characteristics of a large-
diameter well, a relationship between the injectivity and/or productivity of slim holes and large-diameter production and/or injection wells is required. Since 1992, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), through Sandia National Laboratories (Sandia), has sponsored a research effort to demonstrate that slim holes can be used to provide reliable geothermal reservoir parameter estimates and to predict the production behavior of large-diameter wells (Combs and Dunn, 1992). To date, the DOE/Sandia slimhole research program has consisted of two primary elements, the first of which was the examination and analysis of slimhole and large-diameter well data from Japanese fields (Garg et al., 1995a, b; Garg and Combs, 1995; Garg and Combs, 1997; Garg, et al., 1998). The second element consisted of the drilling and testing of slim holes in several geothermal fields in the western U.S. to compare with offset large-diameter production wells. The first of these cost-shared tests, a 1220 m deep slim hole, was completed in mid-1993 at the Steamboat Hills Geothermal Field, Nevada (Finger, et al., 1994; Combs and Goranson, 1995). During 1995, two other deep slim holes were drilled, completed and tested at the Vale, Oregon and Newberry Crater, Oregon, geothermal prospects under the DOE/Sandia slimhole technology program (Finger, et al.,",1996; 1997).,"Analysis of the discharge and injection test data from both the slim holes and large-diameter production and injection wells performed under the DOE/Sandia slimhole technology program for four Japanese (Oguni, Sumikawa, Takigami, and Kirishima, and one U.S. (Steamboat Hills) geothermal field are summarized and discussed in this paper. Based on examination of production and injection data from these five geothermal fields, it is concluded that the performance of large-diameter geothermal wells with liquid or two-phase feedzones may be forecast using discharge and/or injection data from slim holes with liquid or two-phase feedzones.",2. ANALYSIS OF DOWNHOLE DATA,"Garg and Combs (1993) presented a review of the publicly available Japanese data regarding slim holes. Slim holes had been successfully used in Japan for (1) obtaining core for geological studies and delineating the subsurface stratigraphic structure, (2) characterizing the geothermal reservoir fluid state, and (3) as shut-in observation boreholes in pressure interference tests. In order to establish the utility of slim holes for definitive reservoir assessment, it is also necessary to be able to predict the discharge characteristics of large-diameter wells based on injection and/or discharge tests on smalldiameter slim holes. When we initiated the DOE/Sandia sponsored slimhole data analysis project, there did not exist sufficient published data, either in Japan or elsewhere, to establish a statistically meaningful relationship between the injectivity/productivity of small-diameter slim holes and of large-diameter production and/or injection wells. However, based on the available proprietary Japanese and U.S. data that
have been obtained and analyzed, we conclude that realistic prediction of discharge characteristics of large-diameter production wells can be made using test data from slim holes.
Both the New Energy and Industrial Technology Organization (NEDO) and the Japanese geothermal operators, have drilled and tested small-diameter coreholes (i.e., slim holes) and large-diameter geothermal wells. We have analyzed the available drilling and testing data from boreholes in four Japanese (Oguni, Sumikawa, Takigami, and Kirishima) and one U.S. (Steamboat Hills) geothermal field which amounts to a total of 159 boreholes, including 68 slim holes and 91 largediameter wells (see Table 1.)
The drilling data from the boreholes included location, surface elevation, total depth, circulation loss data, borehole completions (e.g., hole sizes, casing sizes and depth intervals, deviation surveys) and geologic data (e.g., stratigraphy, rock type, formation depth intervals). The downhole data after completion of the boreholes and during injection and discharge testing includes PTS (i.e., pressure, temperature and spinner) surveys to obtain feedzone depths, pressures and temperatures.",3. INJECTION TESTS,"It is a common practice in Japan to conduct a short term (i.e., a few hours) injection test soon after the drilling and completion of a borehole. The injection test consists of injecting cold water into the borehole and simultaneously recording pressure and temperature downhole. The pressure and temperature tool in most of the injection tests are placed either near or above the principal feedzone. Because of wellbore cooling due to the injection of cold fluid, the measured change in pressure at the gauge depth will underestimate the change in pressure at the feedzone depth; however, the decrepancy will decline with continued injection. After the injection of a few wellbore volumes, the temperature in the depth interval between the gauge and feedzone depths should approach a stable value; hence, the rates of pressure change at the two depths will be similar.
The Injectivity Index (II), calculated from data obtained during the injection tests, is defined as follows:
II = M/(Pflowing - Pstatic)
where M is the mass injection rate (single rate test), Pflowing is the flowing pressure (at the gauge depth) during cold water injection, and Pstatic is the shut-in pressure at the gauge depth. For multi-rate injection tests, the equation becomes
II = ∆M/∆P
where ∆M/∆P is the slope of the straight-line fit to the multistep injection rate versus injection pressure (at gauge depth) data.
From the data obtained from the four Japanese geothermal fields, injection tests were performed on thirty-nine (39) slim holes and forty-six (46) large-diameter wells (see Table 2). The borehole data from Steamboat Hills provided another four (4) slim holes and four (4) large-diameter wells.",4. DISCHARGE TESTS,"A borehole must be discharged to ascertain its productive capacity. During most of the discharge tests, pressure and temperature (or pressure, temperature and spinner) surveys were run. These pressure/temperature surveys were used to calculate the productivity indices for the boreholes. The Productivity Index, PI, is defined as follows:
PI = M/( Pstatic - Pflowing)
where M is the discharge (i.e., mass production) rate, Pstatic is the stable (static) feedzone (or gauge depth) pressure, and Pflowing is the flowing feedzone (or gauge depth) pressure. For some of the boreholes that were analyzed, multi-rate discharge tests were performed, and pressures were recorded downhole with Kuster gauges or capillary tube type gauges. These pressure data can be used to determine the productivity index as follows:
PI = ∆M/∆P
where ∆M/∆P is the slope of the straight-line fit to the multistep discharge rate versus flowing pressure (at gauge depth) data.
As part of the discharge tests of the Japanese boreholes, the characteristic output curves (i.e., mass and enthalpy versus wellhead pressure) were also obtained.
From the data obtained from the four Japanese geothermal fields, discharge tests were performed on twenty-nine (29) slim holes and thirty-eight (38) large-diameter wells (see Table 3). The boreholes at Steamboat Hills provided data from another four (4) slim holes and four (4) large-diameter wells.",5. PRODUCTIVITY AND INJECTIVITY INDICES,"Discharge capacity of a geothermal borehole is principally determined by pressure losses associated with flow (1) in the reservoir rocks, and (2) in the wellbore. Ignoring pressure transient effects, the flow resistance (i.e., pressure losses) of the reservoir rocks can be represented by the productivity index. Prediction of the mass output of a large-diameter well based on discharge data from a slim hole requires, among other things, a relationship between productivity index and borehole diameter.
Because of the increased importance of frictional and heat losses in small-diameter boreholes, it is often difficult to discharge slim holes. There is, however, no problem with performing injection tests and determining the injectivity index of slim holes. If a relationship can be established between injectivity and productivity indices, then it should be possible to use injection tests on slim holes to predict the probable discharge characteristics of large-diameter wells.
Based on theoretical considerations, Pritchett (1993) and Hadgu, et al. (1994) have suggested that apart from any differences associated with variations in wellbore skin (i.e., near borehole formation damage or stimulation), the productivity (or injectivity) index should exhibit only a weak dependence on borehole diameter. With the exception of Oguni boreholes, the productivity and injectivity data indicate
that indeed theory does match observed data. Both the productivity and injectivity indices for Oguni boreholes display a systematic dependence on borehole diameter which is most likely due to the interaction of the drilling fluids and the fracture characteristics in the subsurface. Garg, et al. (1995) had ascribed the apparent variation of productivity/injectivity indices with borehole diameter to differences in drilling techniques (i.e., core drilling versus rotary drilling); however, the injectivity and productivity index data for Takigami, Sumikawa, and Kirishima boreholes indicate that core drilling (with complete circulation loss) did not result in any impairment of borehole injectivity/productivity.
Both productivity and injectivity indices were derived for twelve (12) slim holes and fifteen (15) large-diameter wells of the Japanese boreholes that discharge from liquid feedzones. Injectivity and productivity indices for Oguni, Sumikawa, Takigami, and Kirishima boreholes with liquid feedzones are displayed in Figure 1. The injectivity and productivity indices for these boreholes with liquid feedzones are equal to first order. Based upon the amount of data and the four orders of magnitude variation of the injectivity and productivity indices (i.e., from ~0.08 kg/s-bar to ~50 kg/s-bar) displayed in Figure 1, it is reasonable to conclude that, in the absence of discharge testing, the injectivity index may be used to compute the flow resistance of naturally fractured geothermal formations to liquid production.
The data from about seven (7) boreholes (i.e., three (3) slim holes and four (4) large-diameter wells) from the Oguni, Sumikawa, and Kirishima Geothermal Fields are characterized by two-phase feedzones, i.e., in these boreholes there is in situ boiling in the geothermal reservoir. The measured maximum discharge rates for boreholes with extensive in situ boiling are substantially lower than for boreholes with liquid feedzones. Based on the data obtained to date, the productivity index for a borehole with in situ boiling is much smaller that the injectivity index. Because of the relative permeability effects, the flow resistance of reservoir rocks is much greater for two-phase flow than single-phase liquid transport.
The injectivity and productivity index data for the Oguni, Sumikawa, and Kirishima boreholes with two-phase feedzones are exhibited in Figure 2. The data in Figure 2 suggest that the productivity index for two-phase transport is approximately one-tenth of the corresponding injectivity index. Because of the sparseness of the data set, the latter conclusion must be regarded as somewhat tentative. Additional studies are required to draw firm conclusions regarding the relationship between injectivity index and twophase productivity index. Data from high-temperature geothermal fields spanning a wide range of transmissivities are needed for these studies.",6. MATHEMATICAL MODELING OF FLUID FLOW,,IN BOREHOLES,"To investigate the relationship between the discharge capacity of slim holes and large-diameter wells with liquid or twophase feedzones, a wellbore simulator may be employed to numerically model the discharge characteristics of boreholes with different diameters. The numerical parameters derived from a fit to actual production data can then be used to
investigate the effect of borehole diameter on the discharge rate.
In order to determine the fluid carrying capacity of geothermal boreholes of varying diameters, Pritchett (1993) conducted numerical simulations assuming that (1) boreholes are of uniform size, (2) pressure losses in the formation are negligible, and (3) boreholes produce from a liquid feedzone. Based on these numerical simulations, Pritchett (1993) found that the maximum discharge rate of a borehole increases at a rate somewhat greater that the square of the borehole diameter (i.e., 2 + n, n>0). For the conditions assumed by Pritchett (feedzone depth = 1500 m, pressure = 80 bars, single phase liquid at 250°C, uniform borehole diameter), n is approximately equal to 0.56. In a similar theoretical study, Hadgu, et al. (1994) have considered single-phase (liquid) adiabatic flow (no heat loss) up a wellbore and suggest that n equals 0.62.
Most large-diameter wells at Oguni and at Sumikawa Geothermal Fields are completed with a 9-5/8 inch (internal diameter 224 mm) cemented casing and a 8-1/2 inch (= 216 mm) open hole; however, in some cases, the open hole is lined with a 7 inch uncemented liner. Thus, most Oguni and Sumikawa large-diameter wells have a more or less uniform internal diameter (= 22 cm), and satisfy one of the key assumptions (i.e., uniform wellbore diameter) made by Pritchett (1993) in his theoretical analysis. We have documented that test data from slim holes with liquid feedzones can be used to predict the discharge characteristics of large-diameter “Oguni-Sumikawa type” wells with liquid feedzones (Garg and Combs, 1995; Garg, et al., 1995a).
To model the flow characteristics of boreholes with both uniform and non-uniform diameter, the wellbore computer simulation program WELBOR (Pritchett, 1985) was utilized. The WELBOR code treats the steady flow of water and/or steam up a borehole. The user provides parameters describing the well geometry (inside diameter and angle of deviation with respect to vertical along the hole length), a stable formation temperature distribution with depth, and an “effective thermal conductivity” representing the effects of conductive heat transfer between the fluid in the wellbore and the surrounding rock formation. Values must also be specified for the flowing feedpoint pressure (or alternatively, stable feedpoint pressure and productivity index) and enthalpy (or alternately, temperature for wells producing from a singlephase liquid zone.) For the borehole calculations made in the present studies, the frictional pressure gradient was treated using Dukler’s correlation (Dukler, et al., 1964) and a user prescribed roughness factor. The relative slip between the liquid and gas phases was simulated using the Hughmark liquid holdup correlation (Hughmark, 1962).
Given the downhole (usually at feedzone depth) values for mass flow, pressure and temperature, the WELBOR code was used to compute the conditions along the wellbore and at the wellhead (pressure, flowing enthalpy, etc.). The principal parameters that were varied to match the measured conditions in the wellbore and at the wellhead are (1) effective thermal conductivity and (2) interior roughness factor. For both the slim holes and large-diameter production wells, WELBOR was used to match the downhole pressure/temperature profiles and the results of characteristic tests.
To illustrate the computational procedure, it is instructive to consider the large-diameter well TT-7 at the Takigami Geothermal Field. The upper section of TT-7 has the largest diameter (ID = 38.13 cm) of all the Takigami production wells. The large-diameter of the upper section is directly responsible for TT-7 being the most prolific production well at Takigami. To assess the effect of the diameter of the upper section on the discharge behavior of the non-uniform largediameter production well TT-7, two calculations were made assuming that the inside diameter of the upper section equals (1) 31.79 cm and (2) 22.44 cm. Most of the Takigami production wells are completed with a 31.79 cm upper section. The upper section diameter of 22.44 cm defines the hypothetical “Oguni-Sumikawa type” well (Garg, et al, 1996). The computed discharge characteristics for these two cases are shown in Figure 3. It is apparent from Figure 3 that the discharge rate is a strong function of the upper section diameter of the well. For the 31.79 cm case, the maximum discharge rate is ~338 tons/hour. The maximum discharge rate for the hypothetical “Oguni-Sumikawa type” well is only ~144 tons/hour. By way of contrast, the measured maximum discharge rate for TT-7 is almost 500 tons/hour.
To investigate the relationship between the discharge capacity of slim holes and large-diameter wells with two-phase feedzones, WELBOR was used to numerically model the discharge characteristics of boreholes with different diameters. The numerical parameters derived from a fit to actual production data can then be used to investigate the effect of borehole diameter on the discharge rate. We have modeled boreholes from the Oguni, Sumikawa, and Kirishima Geothermal Fields with two-phase feedzones. For both slim holes and large-diameter wells with two-phase feedzones, WELBOR was used to match the downhole pressure/temperature profiles. The model parameters (roughness factor, holdup parameter) derived from fits to downhole data were then employed to match the results of characteristic tests by varying feedzone pressure and enthalpy. Finally, the discharge characteristics of a “standard” largediameter well were predicted using model parameters (roughness factor, holdup parameter, productivity index) for slim holes.
Kirishima slim hole KE1-6 discharged a mixture of water and steam with wellhead enthalpies ranging from 937 kJ/kg to 1009 kJ/kg, implying that the discharge from KE1-6 was accompanied by in situ boiling. The downhole pressure profile in KE1-6 was simulated (Garg et al, 1998) to obtain a set of model parameters (roughness factor, holdup parameters, productivity index) that would match the measured characteristic discharge data. The downhole pressure profile was matched with a discharge rate of 9.0 tons/hour together with a feedzone pressure of 16.54 bars yielding a productivity index of 0.044 kg/s-bar compared to the value of ~0.05 kg/sbar obtained from test measurements. With the calculated model parameters from slim hole KE1-6, the maximum discharge rate for a typical large-diameter geothermal well (224 mm ID cased interval, 159 mm ID uncemented liner in 216 mm open hole) was computed to be 14.8 tons/hour. The calculated maximum discharge rate for the large-diameter well with two-phase feedzones is not much greater than that for slim hole KE1-6. Because of the very small productivity index, most of the pressure drop takes place in the formation. Thus, as far as the maximum discharge rate is concerned, the formation (and not the well diameter) is the limiting factor.
Increasing the well diameter does not result in a commensurate increase in the discharge rate. Slim hole KE1-6 has a productivity index (~0.05 kg/s-bar) similar to that for large-diameter well KE1-21. The maximum discharge rate for KE1-21 was measured as ~13.5 tons/hour.",7. CONCLUSIONS,"Production and injection test data from boreholes with liquid feedzones imply that (1) productivity and injectivity indices are more or less equal, and (2) discharge rate of largediameter wells with liquid feedzones may be predicted based on test data from slim holes with liquid feedzones. Based on the amount of data and the range of values for the indices from the Oguni, Sumikawa, Takigami, and Kirishima Geothermal Fields, it can be concluded that in the absence of discharge testing, the injectivity index may be used to characterize the flow resistance of naturally fractured geothermal reservoir rocks to liquid production. The productivity/injectivity indices for slim holes provide a lower bound on the corresponding indices for large-diameter wells. Thus, the productivity index (or more importantly, injectivity index in the absence of discharge data) from a slim hole with a liquid feedzone can be used to provide a first estimate of the probable discharge capacity of a large-diameter geothermal production well.
A wellbore simulator, WELBOR, was used to model the discharge characteristics of both slim holes and large-diameter wells at Takigami. The model parameters were used to calculate the probable discharge characteristics of “OguniSumikawa type” wells (Garg, et al., 1996). The predicted average maximum discharge rate (for “Oguni-Sumikawa type” wells) using Takigami slim hole data is identical with that obtained from measurements from large-diameter production wells at Takigami. Thus, the Takigami data from non-uniform diameter wells imply that the discharge characteristics of large-diameter wells with liquid feedzones may be predicted based on test data from slim holes with liquid feedzones.
Modeling of large-diameter Takigami wells also suggests that using large-diameter casing in the two-phase section of a well has a large beneficial effect on the discharge capacity of geothermal wells with liquid feedzones and moderate to good productivity indices. By way of contrast, increasing well diameter in the liquid portion of the well has little influence on the discharge capacity. Additionally, for wells with low productivity indices, the discharge rate is largely independent of well diameter. These results suggest the importance of well design. For optimum production, the well design should include consideration of fluid state (pressure, temperature, gas content, etc.) and formation characteristics (e.g., productivity index).
Analysis of injection and production data from boreholes with two-phase feedzones from the Oguni, Sumikawa, and Kirishima Geothermal Fields indicates that the two-phase productivity index is about an order of magnitude smaller than the injectivity index. Because of the sparseness of the data set, this conclusion should be confirmed by additional data. Simulation of characteristic data from large-diameter wells
shows that both the productivity index and feedzone enthalpy undergo changes with variations in feedzone pressure and discharge rate. Lowering the feedzone pressure results in enhanced boiling and hence greater steam phase mobility. The variations in productivity index and feedzone enthalpy are, however, modest (~ 10 percent), and suggest that the productivity index and feedzone enthalpy corresponding to maximum discharge rate (and lowest feedzone pressure) from slim holes should be used to estimate the discharge capacity of large-diameter wells.
For boreholes with poor productivity indices, almost all of the pressure drop takes place in the formation, and increasing borehole diameter has little or no influence on the discharge capacity of the boreholes. The discharge capacity for these boreholes is limited by the formation characteristics, and not by the borehole diameter. From the data analyzed to date, it appears that a productivity index of the order of 0.3 kg/s-bar is needed to obtain economically significant discharge rates from a geothermal well. Data from slim hole KE1-6 and large-diameter well KE1-21 in the Kirishima Geothermal Field suggest that barring variations in the productivity index with borehole diameter, it should be possible to deduce the discharge characteristics of large-diameter wells using test data from slim holes with two-phase feedzones.
This latter conclusion must, of course, be confirmed by data from a statistically significant number of boreholes with twophase feedzones. Additional studies are required to better understand relationships (1) between injectivity index and two-phase productivity index, (2) between borehole diameter and two-phase productivity index, and (3) between well completion (i.e., diameter) and the discharge capacity of boreholes with two-phase feedzones. Data from a set of hightemperature geothermal fields spanning a wide range of transmissivities are needed for these later studies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Combs, J. and Dunn, J.C.

Because of this cost differential, it is desirable to use slim holes for geothermal reservoir assessment. Production and injection data from slim holes and large-diameter wells at five geothermal fields (Oguni, Sumikawa, Takigami, and Kirishima, Japan; Steamboat Hills, U.S.A.) were examined to establish relationships (1) between productivity and injectivity indices, and (2) between discharge capacity of slim holes and large diameter wells. For boreholes with liquid feedzones, the productivity and injectivity indices are more or less equal, and the discharge rate of large-diameter wells can be predicted using either production or injection test data from slim holes. Analysis of injection and production data from boreholes for which discharge is accompanied by in situ boiling indicates that productivity index is about an order of magnitude smaller than the injectivity index. A wellbore simulator (WELBOR) was employed to investigate the effect of borehole diameter on the discharge capacity of boreholes with in situ boiling. Preliminary results imply that the discharge data from slim holes together with a wellbore simulator can be used to estimate the discharge capacity of large-diameter wells with two-phase feedzones.",ADOBEPS4.DRV Version 4.26,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several two-dimensional fractured porous medium models have been developed for The Geysers; these models differ in assumptions regarding the initial liquid saturation and matrix permeabilities. These models indicate that the permeability-thickness product (M) of the fracture network ranges from 10 to 75 Dm (30,000 to 225,000 md-ft) and matrix permeability ranges from 1 to 3 pDarcies (pD). All three models yielded surprisingly similar predictions regarding the future generating capacities of different areas. Introduction The Earth Sciences Division of Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory (LBL) is conducting research studies on The Geysers geothermal field for the California State Lands Commission (SLC). SLC receives royalties for steam produced from State-owned leases at The Geysers, and the funds are used for the California Teachers Retirement Fund. The LBL project on The Geysers started in 1985 with the development of a comprehensive computerized data base; the following year various geological and reservoir engineering studies were conducted using the data base. During the last two years numerical modeling studies were canied out with the purpose of understanding the reservoir response to production and injection. In this paper various aspects of resource assessment of The Geysers are discussed. The available data are briefly described and some results of data analysis are presented. Then the limitations of the data base for numerical modeling are discussed and poorly known reservoir parameters are identified. Different modeling approaches are evaluated in terms of The Geysers data and infomation regarding appropriate initial and boundary conditions are summarized. Finally, two-dimensional fractured/porous medium models of The Geysers and some simulation results are described.",Acrobat Capture 3.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the Podhale district of the Taua mountains in the south-east, promising geothermal resources have in recent years been located through deep drilling. These resources could he used for district heating in and Nowy Targ, but also far developing health

According recent studies, based on geological and petroleum exploration, the total potential heat energy contained i n geothermal waters in Poland has tentatively been estimated at close to 35 billion tons of Standard Fuel. Only a small fraction of this potential has so far been utilized. (Gladysz et al., 1994, Sokolowski, A significant part of this potential is thought to he economically exploitable, making geothermal waters an important alternative energy source for district heating, and agriculture. The harnessing of this resource would make an important contribution to environmental protection. It has been estimated that heating Poland with geothermal energy and natural gas could reduce present-day pollutanr emissions by about some (Sokolowski, 1993). Several studies also indicate that the cost of geothermal heating may in some cases be lower than that of conventional energy sources such as coal, lignite, natural gas or fuel oil (Sokolowski, 1993).
The Czech Republic In the Czech Republic, as in Poland, there is also a long tradition for baths and spas based on natural hot springs in places such as Karlovy Vary, Lame and Teplice. But other uses based on the systematic exploitation of geothermal through drilling and pumping have been rather limited. Even if the Czech Republic is relatively less endowed with geothermal resources than its neighbours, Poland and Slovakia, the thermal waters still represent a viable potential source of energy.

Various theoretical studies indicate that the heat-energy potential of geothermal waters in the Czech Republic may be of order of 3,300 MW (0.Franko et al., 1990, and an unpublished note by J. Franko, 1994). This figure is by its very nature highly tentative and, due the dispersed and local nature of the resource, its potential economic importance greatly depends on the mode and intensity of utilization. But it seems likely that a significant of the domestic heating needs in the Czech Republic could be met with geothermal water instead of fossil fuels 1993).
The geothermal potential in Slovakia is of considerable significance. Geothermal resources are found both under the
near Bratislava in aquiferous layers of sand- Fig. 4. Geothermal Resources in Hungary
In recent decades a significant use of thermal water has been developed for and agricultural purposes in greenhouses et al., In recent years, more modern technology has been employed to harness geothermal resources in Hungary, but the systems in use remain relatively primitive, have low energy efficiency and do not optimize production from the geothermal reservoirs. Better solutions are also needed to deal with the environmental impact of geothermal development.
No comprehensive estimates are available for the total economically exploitable geothermal resources in Hungary. but it is certain that only a very small fraction of this potential has been harnessed. It has been tentatively estimated that some 12% of the heating needs Hungary's urban papulation could economically be met with geothermal energy In several Hungarian towns, plans have been made for geothermal heating systems, which could result in considerable economic and environmental benefits 1993).
countries Summing up, does not seem farfetched to say that up to of the space heating needs of the Visegrad countries could economically be met using low-temperature geothermal energy instead of conventional fuel 1993). Such a replacement of fossil fuels would reduce air pollution in Central Europe significantly. This is not only in the interest of the inhabitants of the but also in that of their neighbours. In view of the serious environmental problems facing Central and Eastern Europe and the economic significance of the potential energy savings, it is of great importance to pursue the study of the geothermal potential and its harnessing in these countries.
2. THE OBSTACLES
The technology for the utilization of geothermal heat is already established and available. Exploitation can be made commercially successful on a significant scale at prevailing world market oil prices. In addition, the substitution of geothermal for fossil energy has a significant positive effect on quality. So why is it that the Central and Eastern European counmes have not developed their geothermal resources? reasons are manifold, and of them have to do with the heritage of the communist system.
It is difficult to generalize about this issue, but to the development of efficient consumer services are to extent rooted in the priority given under communism to the military and other state activities. Intellectual effort simply did not focus on solving the everyday problems of the household sector. It is clear that the central planning mechanism and inadequate pricing of intermediate goods and services, including energy, with prices too low to cover the full real cost supply, did not give priority to or provide incentives for effective provision of services such as space heating. For these reasons, energy efficiency was not given priority. insulation of buildings and pipelines was the rule rather than the exception, and heating and ventilation systems paid scant regard to real energy costs. Collective housing seldom had individual heat meters for each dwelling unit, which further reduced consumer awareness of the real costs of heating. The inflexible central planning of the supply of energy could at the same time be wasteful of energy and unsatisfactory for private household needs.
These are some of the causes of lack of investment in efficient heating systems in general and in geothermal energy development in particular. The most profound problem is the unrealistically low price of intermediate products. including energy, which in fact is still prevalent in many of the countries in transition. It is also a fact that the use of geothermal energy
requires (in common with most other renewable and nuclear energy technologies) the bulk of the costs over the lifetime of the project to be incurred prior to start-up of the operation. Expenditures on exploration of the geothermal resource and other pre-investment costs are large compared with conventional fuel heating systems. The costs and benefits are, of course, always project specific and the profitability of geothermal projects depends heavily on the price of conventional fuels and the cost of capital, interest rates, but the circumstances in the general economic environment described above have been an impediment to geothermal development.
These considerations bring us of the nexus of problems belonging to the communist heritage and into the problems of transition and the policies of both the authorities of the countries in transition and the fin. institutions that are actively engaged in facilitating the and the transfer of and technology from the Western democratic counmes Io Central and Eastern Europe. The decision-makers on both sides tend to favour large scale projects with very shon pay-back periods and high internal rates of return i n a Strictly commercial sense.There is also a tendency to favour export-oriented rather than projects. Furthermore, there may still an inclination to favour high-profile, national projects. Projects aiming at direct use of geothermal heat are most often relatively small and low-key, and always local rather than national in character.
The environmental impact of geothermal energy systems is clearly dependent on local site conditions and the choice of technology. However, geothermal systems generally can have an impact on the environment through one or more of the following: airborne emissions, solid wastes, brine disposal, chemical and thermal pollution of surface and ground water, noise, induced seismicity and ground subsidence. It is important to consider all these potential impacts for each project separately and compare them with alternative energy sources. In most cases the environmental impact of geothermal solutions compares very favourably with Conventional fuel systems. In spite of the desire of the countries in transition to give high priority to investments in environmental protection, financing may be more difficult to find far geothermal projects as the environmental benefits do
directly show up in the cash-flows of the projects. But in spite of all these obstacles, there are good examples of geothermal projects with a satisfactory financial rate of return.
NEED FOR NEW FINANCING MECHANISMS
A thorough understanding of the obstacles to investment in geothermal energy necessary for effective remedial action by national authorities as well as by an international community desiring to facilitate the process of transition. The key to a successful geothermal project is to ensure by careful surveying, exploration, evaluation and monitoring that there is a good match between the scheduled lifetime of the necessary installations and the endurance of the geothermal reservoir itself. and that the project will pay its calculating all inputs and outputs at market prices.
The counmes (and several other Eastern European countries) have made initial country surveys of geothermal activity and have outstanding geologists and geophysicists carry further surveys. But there is a need for financial support for surveying and exploration as well as for the transfer of knowledge of modern geothermal technology and its management. There is a need to train professionals for these specialized tasks and to local authorities and entrepreneurs in making feasibility studies for the most promising projects.
Grants for these tasks constitute without doubt a very effective
use of technical assistance funds.
Because of the environmental benefits derived from geothermal energy use, consideration should also be given to a system of grants to get geothermal project investment going beyond the surveying, exploring and feasibility study stages. In some Western European countries, public grants are given for geothermal exploration and later converted into commercially priced loans if the project turns to be profitable.
Lines Credit Most there need to be special financing mechanisms to provide financing for public utilities interested in geothermal district heating systems. One important approach to this problem would be for the multilateral financial institutions to establish lines of credit with national lending institutions in each country for this purpose, as most individual projects of this kind may be too small to separate loans from the multilateral banks. In this way, financing would be further facilitated if these countries' governments would demonstrate their support by putting guarantees behind such lines of credit, and national financial intermediaries to provide finance for local authorities and reliable companies wanting to undertake long-term investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy. The financial position of local authorities utility companies that are responsible for heating systems is weak in most of the countries in transition, and so central government backing is needed for significant investments.
It is important to recognize that it is precisely during the transition phase that official government backing is needed, while the domestic prices of fossil fuels are being brought up to world market prices and a stable economic environment established. Careful studies need to be made in each case of whether district hearing systems are more efficient than individual household heating systems, systems based on natural gas. using separate heating units for each household. But the environmental aspects should always be considered when assessing the costs and benefits of alternative systems.
The of the Visegmd For a successful transition to democracy and market economy it is essential to develop efficient consumer-oriented infrastructures in the countries in transition to improve the quality of daily life. Far this reason it may be necessary to adopt new methods and financial mechanisms. The most important single, general measure is comprehensive price reform including all the prices in the table of the economy. In the long run the introduction of market prices for energy as well as for other goods and services will create new harnessing of geothermal resources.
A general economic environment that is conducive to sound investment is a very important condition for economic progress. In this respect we face a very contrasting situation among the countries in On the one hand, we have countries where structural reform and macro-economic stabilisation are well underway and whose economic performance is improving, such as the Visegrad and Baltic countries. On the other hand there are countries in transition that are still wrestling with the initial problems of political and structural reform, and where the economic situation still very difficult. There is a clear need to demonstrate that the transition to democracy and a market economy can bring with it positive social development and improved living standards. The Visegrad countries could and should lead the way. is not enough to achieve short-term economic stabilisation. Essential to sustainable economic growth is opportunity for local utilities and small and medium- size businesses to develop. For this purpose, market-oriented local financial institutions are of critical importance. A coordinated effort is needed among the international financial institutions that are engaged in assisting the transition process in central and
eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, to refinance local financial intermediaries and to other sources of finance, public as well as private, for this important task. The European Bank for and Development, the World Bank and its affiliates, the European Investment Bank and the Nordic Investment Bank and other agencies assisting in the transition process should separately and jointly address this question.
4. PILOT PROJECTS
Successful pilot projects that demonstrate the advantages of geothermal energy are very important for the future of geothermal development. this purpose, it is advisable to build on existing improving and extending them, technically and economically. Small-scale projects are best suited to this
A promising pilot project is being implemented by the town council of Pyrzyce in Poland, where a combined gas power plant is under construction to heat this town of 14,000 residents. (Sokolowski, 1993). Another interesting pilot project is under way in the town of Galanta where the local authorities, together with the government owned gas company, Priemysel, the Nordic Environment Finance Corporation, and Icelandic interests have formed a company to build and operate a geothermal district heating system for the town's 35,000 inhabitants, 1,300 households, schools, hospital and health facilities. It is expected that the Icelandic shareholders will contribute not only project engineering and financing but also provide management support for the operation of the system the basis of many decades of experience of running geothermal heating systems with great in the city of Reykjavik and other Icelandic communities.
The Galanta project is seen to he technically, financially and economically viable, with an estimated internal rate of return before taxes of more than a sustainable cash-flow through the lifetime of the project, and a pay-back period of years. The preparations for the project have been made by the Galanta city council. The existing district heating system will be upgraded and provided with geothermally heated water. This interesting project will also be partly financed by the Nordic Investment Bank, and pre-investment support was granted to the project by the Nordic Project Fund. The Galanta project seems to contain all the necessary elements for a pilot project: careful local preparation, good international cooperation and transfer of financial resources and technology to improve energy efficiency and economy in the heating system of this small Slovakian community. Hopefully, the gallant examples of Galanta and Pyrzyce are a harbinger of a new phase of geothermal development in Central and Eastern Europe.

5. CONCLUSIONS
The main conclusions that can be drawn from the available material on geothermal potential in the four Visegrad countries are the following:
A significant of space heating needs could economically met using geothermal resources.
Development geothermal energy to replace fossil fuel could reduce air pollution in Central Europe significantly.
Price reform is needed secure realistic market-based pricing of energy, which would facilitate investment in geothermal energy systems.
New financing mechanisms are needed to promote investment in energy efficiency and renewable energy. The multilateral financial institutions operating in the counmes in transition should establish special lines of credit for this purpose in cooperation with national financial intermediaries. It is particularly important that the central governments in the transition countries back up the local authorities in this undertaking.
Transfer technology and management know-how for geothermal systems from countries that have developed in this field is as imponant the transfer of financial resources.
Well-prepared pilot are important to demonstrate the potential for geothermal development to improve energy efficiency and air quality.

JONES Department of Geology, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana 70803, USA Heat flow and geotemperature in the upper part of the earth's crust are primarily functions of mass transfer, solid and / or fluid. The factors which control the occurrences and rates of mass transfer define the geothermal regime in space and time. Downward intrusion of the crust by sediments that formed the Gulf Coast geosyncline during the Cenozoic, and contemporaneous upward intrusion of the sediment fill by hundreds-perhaps thousands-of salt diapirs from an underlying Mesozoic evaporite bed are the dominant elements of rock mass transfer in the Gulf basin. Delayed and retarded release of interstitial, intracrystalline, and bound water in the Cenozoic sediments, controlled by the thermophysical and thermochemical properties of sediment minerals and the effects of structural deformation and sediment facies distribution, are the most important factors in the geothermal regime of the basin. Prograding alluvial and deltaic systems built gulfward from the northwestern margin of the basin in eight major cycles of fill during the Cenozoic. The sandy deltaic deposits overloaded the underlying fine-grained sediments, and sank into them as their waters were squeezed out. Major shear zones (contemporaneous faults) developed at the underlying facies boundaries, and offset sand-bed aquifer systems were compartmentalized and geopressured. Retardation of water loss from the geopressured zone has retarded heat flow, and geothermal gradients in the geopressured zone are generally three to five times greater than those in the hydropressure zone above. Wherever the geopressure zone ""leaks,"" a thermal ""high"" occurs-in both the geopressure zone and the overlying hydropressure zone. The principal avenue of leakage is up fault planes of contemporaneous faults, mainly where the downthrown block includes extensive sand-bed aquifer systems that serve to drain over-pressured clay.","Atalasoft, Inc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SUMMARY - Downhole heat exchangers (DHE) consists of a system of pipes or tubes suspended in a well through which “clean” secondary water is pumped or allowed to circulate by natural convection to provide space heating of buildings. The DHE eliminates the problem of disposal of geothermal fluid, since only heat is taken from the well. DHEs are used extensive in approximately 600 wells in Klamath Falls, Oregon. Corrosion has been a problem for the DHE pipes, especially at the air-water interface, with the use of cross-linked polyethylene (PEX) pipes currently being investigated to solve this problem. In order to increase the heat output from a well using a DHE, a vertical convection cell is developed by perforating the casing at the bottom of “live water” flow and just below the lowest static water surface. Where these perforations have not been provided, typical of older wells, pumping and dumping water to the storm sewers in Klamath Falls has been utilized. This disposal of geothermal water had lowered well water throughout the City.

These systems offer substantial economic savings over surface heat exchangers where a single-well system is adequate (typically less than 0.8 MWt, with well depths up to about 150 m and may be economical under certain conditions at well depths to 450 m (Lund, et al., 1975; Culver and Lund, 1999).
Several designs have proven successful; but, the most popular are a simple hairpin loop or multiple loops of iron pipe (similar to the tubes in a U-tube and shell exchanger) extending to near the well bottom (Figure 1). An experimental design consisting of multiple small tubes with “headers” at each end suspended just below the water surface appears to offer economic and heating capacity advantages in shallow wells. In order to obtain maximum output, the well must be designed to have an open annulus between the well bore and the casing, and perforations at the well bottom for the inflow aquifer and just below the lowest static water surface. Natural
265 UTILISATION
convection circulates the water down inside the casing, through the lower perforations, up in the annulus and back inside the casing through the upper perforations. If the design parameters of bore diameter, casing diameter, heat exchanger length, tube diameter, number of loops, flow rate and inlet temperature are carefully selected, the velocity and mass flow of the natural convection in the well may approach those of a conventional shell-and-tube heat exchanger. However, this balance is often difficult to achieve, and is usually done by trial and error or based on local experience.
The interaction between the fluid in the aquifer and that in the well is not fully understood; but, it appears that outputs are higher where there is a high degree of vertical fluid mixing in the well bore indicating that somewhat permeable formations with high flows are preferred.
Considering life and replacement costs, materials should be selected to provide economical protection from corrosion. Attention must be given to the anodic-cathodic relationship between the exchanger and the casing since it is relatively expensive to replace the well casing. Experience in the approximately 600 downhole exchangers in use in Klamath Falls indicates that corrosion is most severe at the air-water interface at static water level and that stray electrical currents can accelerate corrosion. Currents of several tens of milliamps have been measured (Lund, et al., 1976a). Insulating unions can be used to isolate the exchanger from stray currents in building and city water lines. Sealing the top of the casing to limit oxygen availability will also reduce the air-water interface corrosion. Average DHE life is difficult to predict. For the 600 or so black iron DHEs in Klamath Falls, average life has been estimated to be 14 years; however, in some instances, regular replacement in 3 - 5 years has been required (Lund, et al., 1975; Lund, et al., 1976b). In other cases, installations have been in service for over 30 years with no problems, especially in capped artesian wells. Stray electrical currents, as noted above, have undoubtedly been a contributing factor in some early failures. In others, examination of DHEs after removal reveals long, deeply corroded lines along one side of the DHE. This may be due to continual thermal expansion and contraction while laying against the side of an uncased well. Constant movement would scrub off protective scale exposing clean surface for further corrosion. Galvanized pipe is to be avoided since many geothermal water leach zinc and the anode-cathode relationship normally protecting steel in pipes reversed at 57oC
266 UTILISATION
(Ellis and Conover, 1981; Ellis, 1998). More recently, a cross-linked polyethylene pipe (PEX) has been tried in wells to overcome the corrosion problem (Chiasson, et al., 2005; Chiasson, et al., 2007).
Corrosion at the air-water interface is by far the most common cause of failure (Figure 2). For some reason, DHE wells are typically left open at the top. There appears to be no good reason they could not be sealed air tight. Once the initial charge of oxygen was used up in forming corrosion products, there would be no more available since there is essentially no dissolved oxygen in the water. Closed wells appear to extend the life of the DHE (Swisher and Wright, 1990). An alternate solution has been putting clean oil, preferably turbine oil (because of environmental acceptability) as is used in enclosed-tube lineshaft pumps, or paraffin in the well appears to help somewhat, but is difficult to accurately evaluate. This practice has been mostly stopped due to the potential pollution of the ground water.","2 DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION DETAILS (CULVER AND REISTAD, 1978)","DHE outputs range from supplying domestic hot water for a single family from a 12-m, 60oC well at Jemez Springs, New Mexico, to over 1 MWt at Ponderosa Junior High School from a 170-m, 94oC 40-cm well in Klamath Falls, Oregon. They have been used in the Moana area of Reno for many years (Allis, 1981). DHEs are also in use in New Zealand, Turkey, Hungary, Iceland, Russia and other countries. A well producing 6 MWt has been reported in use in Turkey (Lund, 1999).
The wells in Klamath Falls are 25- or 30-cm in diameter drilled 6 or meter into “live water” and an 20-cm casing installed. “Live water” is locally described as a hot water aquifer with sufficient flow and permeability to wash away the fines produced in a cable-tool drilling operation or major lost circulation in rotary drilling. A packer is placed around the casing below any cold water or unconsolidated rock, usually at depths of 6 - 15 m, and the well cemented from the packer to the surface. The casing is torch perforated 1 x 15 cm in the “live water” area and just below the lowest static water level. Perforated sections are usually 4 - 9 m long and the total cross-sectional area of the perforations should be at least one-and-a-half to two times the casing cross section. Since water levels fluctuate summer to winter, the upper perforations should start below the lowest expected level. A 2- or 2.5-cm diameter pipe welded to the casing and extended from surface to below the packer permits sounding and temperature measurements in the annulus and is very useful in diagnosing well problems.
The space heating DHE is usually 4- or 5-cm diameter black iron pipe with a return U at the bottom. The domestic water DHE is 2- or 2.5-cm diameter pipe (Figure 3). The return U
267 UTILISATION
usually has a 0.9 – 1.5 m section of pipe (called a mud leg) welded on the bottom to act as a trap for corrosion products that may fill the U preventing free circulation. Couplings should be malleable rather than cast to facilitate removal (Figure 2).
Other DHE types in use are short multiple tubes with headers at each end and straight pipes extending to near the well bottom with coils of copper or steel pipe at the ends. In Reno, Nevada, many DHE wells are pumped by small submersible pumps to induce hot water to flow into the well. Systems for use with heat pumps circulate refrigerant in DHE pipes. A 20-kWt, 5-m prototype heat pipe system was successfully tested at least several months in the Agnano geothermal field in southern Italy (Cannaviello, et al., 1982).
The first downhole heat exchanger, locally known as a coil, was installed in a geothermal well in Klamath Falls about 1930, designed and installed by a local plumber, Charile Lieb (Geo-Heat Center, 2002). The temperature of the well water and the predicated heat load determine the length of pipe required.
Based on experience, local heating system contractors estimate approximately 1 ft of coil per 1.4 kW/m required as an average for the year. The “thermo-syphon” (or gravity feed in standard hot-water systems) process circulates the domestic water, picking up heat in the well and releasing the heat to the radiators in the building. Circulation pumps are required in cooler wells or in larger systems to increase the flow rate. Thermo-syphon circulation will provide 0.2 - 0.35 bar pressure difference in the supply and return lines to circulate 1 - 1.5 L/sec with a 5 - 11oC temperature change.
There were several older or cooler wells in Klamath Falls that were pumped directly into the storm sewers or canal. In most cases, the well was pumped in order to increase the flow of geothermal waters and to raise the temperature of the well to a level locally considered satisfactory for use in space heating, about 60oC (Figure 4). In a few instances, mostly in the artesian area, well water was pumped or allowed to flow directly through the heating system. This process of “pumping and dumping” has been stopped by City ordinance in 1990 as described later in this paper.
Various types of non-metallic pipe such as PVC, polybutylene and fiberglass reinforced epoxy (FRP) have been tried as DHE, most do not perform well in temperatures near boiling. Although the thermal conductivity for non-metallic pipes is much lower, the overall heat
268 UTILISATION
transfer coefficient is a combination of the pipe thermal conductivity, film coefficients, and conductivity of any scale or corrosion products on both sides. Since the non-metallic pipe is smooth, does not corrode and scale does not stick to it, the overall heat transfer can be nearly as good. As mentioned early, PEX pipe is now being tested in Klamath Falls",3 CONVECTION CELLS,"Downhole heat exchangers extract heat by two methods–extracting heat from water flowing through the aquifer and extracting stored heat from the rocks surrounding the well, the former being most significant.
Although the interaction between the water in the well, water in the aquifer, and the rock surrounding the well is poorly understood, it is known that the heat output can be significantly increased if a convection cell can be set up in the well. Also, there must be some degree of mixing (i.e., water from the aquifer) continuously entering the well, mixing the well water, and water leaving the well to the aquifer. There are two methods of inducing convection: 1) casing perforations, and 2) “pumping and dumping”.
When a well is drilled in a competent formation and will stand open without casing, an undersized casing can be installed. If the casing is perforated just below the lowest static water level and the near the bottom at the hot aquifer level, a convection cell is induced and the well becomes very nearly isothermal between the perforations (Figure 5). Cold surface water and unstable formations near the surface are cemented off above a packer. If a DHE is then installed and heat extracted, a convection cell is induced, flowing down inside the casing and up in the annulus between the well wall and casing. The driving force is the density difference between the water surrounding the DHE and water in the annulus. The more heat extracted, the higher the velocity. Velocities of 0.6 m/s have been measured with very high heat extraction rates; but, the usual velocities are between 0.01 - 0.1 m/s.
269 UTILISATION
In Klamath Falls, it has been experimentally verified that when a well is drilled there is no flow in the wellbore (see Figure 6). When the undersized perforated casing is installed, a convection cell is set up flowing up the inside of the casing and down the annulus between the casing and well wall. When a DHE is installed and heat is extracted, the convection cell reverses flowing down in the casing (around the DHE) and up the annulus. Similar circulation patterns were noted in New Zealand using convection promoters.
In New Zealand, where high temperature wells (up to 160oC) do not stand open and several layers of cold water must be cased off, a system using a convection promoter pipe was developed (Figure 7) (Allis and James, 1979). The convector pipe is simply a pipe open at both ends suspended in the well above the bottom and below the static water level. The DHE can be installed either in the convector or outside the convector, the latter being more economical since a smaller convector is used. Both lab and field tests indicate that the convection cell velocities are about the same in optimized designs and are similar to those measured in the undersized casing system. A summary of the New Zealand research can be found in the following references: Allis and James, 1979; Freeston and Pan, 1983; Dunstall and Freeston, 1990; Hailer and Dunstall, 1992.
270 UTILISATION
Optimum conditions exist when frictional resistance due to wetted surfaces (hydraulic radius) is equal in both legs of the cell and DHE surface area providing maximum heat transfer. For the undersized casing and DHE inside the convector, this occurs when the casing or convector is 0.7 times the well diameter and 0.5 times the well diameter when the DHE is outside the convector. The full length U-Tube DHE is 0.25 times the well diameter in all cases. Partial length or multitube exchangers will have different ratios.
Maximum convection rates are obtained when the casing or convector pipe are insulated from each other. This maintains the temperature and density difference between the cell legs. Nonmetallic pipe is preferred. Although corrosion products help insulate the pipe, scaling does not normally occur to any great degree since the casing or convector are the same temperature as the water.",4 EXPERIMENTAL WORK IN KLAMATH FALLS,,4.1 BACKGROUND,"Many of the earlier wells drilled in Klamath Falls were not completed with the two sets of casing perforations that would generate the convection cells to maximize the output of the downhole heat exchangers (DHE). To provide for this vertical convection of the hotter water from the bottom of the well, they were equipped with a small suction pump that pumped water from the well to the storm sewer – locally referred to as “pumping and dumping.” This pumping provided approximately the same energy transfer to the downhole heat exchanger as the convection cell. Approximately 60 wells in the City had these pumps, and could be
271 UTILISATION
identified by the steam rising from the storm water grates adjacent to the well. In addition, larger users, such as Oregon Institute of Technology, who could not generate enough energy from a downhole heat exchangers, pumped water for the plate heat exchangers in the various buildings on campus, and dumped the waste water to surface drainage.
Unfortunately, there was a noticeable decline in the static water surfaces in geothermal wells in the area, averaging about 30 cm per year, which of course, was a concern to well owners. This decline affected the performance of approximately 400 wells with downhole heat exchangers used for residential heating. As a result, the City passed an ordinance in 1985 which prohibited surface disposal of geothermal fluids by July of 1990 (Lienau, 1989). A well owner had to either drill an injection well or use a downhole heat exchanger without pumping the water if they wished to continue using the geothermal fluids for heating. For some well owners, this meant shutting down their system, as they could not afford to drill an injection well, as their well without pumping could not deliver the required heat. Oregon Institute of Technology had to drill several injection wells before two satisfactory ones could be completed.
By the early 1990s, water level had stabilized and in many cases rose to earlier level, as a result of the City ordinance. Then, in September of 1993 two earthquakes of 5.9 and 6.0 magnitude occurred at an approximate depth of 12 km and 25 km north west of the center of Klamath Falls (Lienau and Lund, 1994). This area of the epicenters is the western extension of the Basin and Range physiographic region of horst and graben structures with high angle normal faults which extends eastward to Salt Lake City. The earthquakes damaged at least 300 structures, some of which had to be demolished. Most of the Klamath Falls geothermal wells tap into flows from one of these normal faults along with east side of the community. Water levels in the geothermal wells rose in zones of compression and fell in zones of extension caused by the earthquakes. Increases up to 90 cm, and decreases up to 2.1 m were recorded (Lienau and Lund, 1994). The Klamath Medical Clinic geothermal well on Main Street started an artesian flow of approximately 2 L/s about 1.5 months before the earthquake and increased to 9.5 L/s after the earthquake with no apparent change in temperature. Since this was a natural phenomena, the City allowed this flow along with discharges from several other wells in the neighborhood (such as the City swimming pool well) to continue flowing to the storm sewer. The artesian level dropped below the casing top with time, thus a suction pump was installed to bring up heat from the bottom and then the water was discharged to the storm sewer (Figure 8). Finally, in 2008, the City served notice to these well owners that they also would have to cease dumping their hot water to the storm sewer.
272 UTILISATION",4.2 THE KLAMATH FALLS MEDICAL CLINIC WORK,"We at the Geo-Heat Center received a call from Pacific Plumbers of Klamath Falls (see coauthors), who had been hired to solve the problem for the Klamath Medical Clinic. We met and discussed several options, such as ripping the casing to produce the necessary holes for a convection cell, installing a smaller perforated casing inside the existing one, lengthening the downhole heat exchanger, or installing a promoter pipe. The present casing only had perforations at the bottom to allow for hot water inflow from the fractured basalt aquifer, thus no natural convection cell was generated. Since the well was cased with a 30-cm diameter casing from the surface to 67 m and then with a 25-cm casing from 64 to the bottom at 108 m and only had one downhole heat exchanger of 6.4-cm diameter, there would be room for a 10-cm diameter promoter pipe. This was then selected as the best solution, as we would not have to remove the estimated 61 m of downhole heat exchanger pipes.
It should be noted that the Klamath Medical Clinic was having trouble heating the facility even when the pump was running. This was especially true for cold mornings and warm afternoon where the system had to adjust to the changing weather conditions. Klamath Falls this past winter had heavy snow falls and night-time temperatures a low as -15oC with averages around - 7oC and average highs typically up to 4oC with maximum up to 10oC. The Clinic has a floor area of 1,115 m2 and an estimated peak heating load of 252,000 kJ/hr plus the domestic hot water heat load.
Promoter pipes had been tried on a limited scale in Klamath Falls previous, but not documented to any extent (see Chiasson, et al., 2005; Chiasson, et al., 2007). The Geo-Heat Center offered their services to design and monitor the results of the promoter pipe installation. In early March, 2008, 108 m of 10-cm diameter promoter pipe was installed. Very few problems were encountered getting the pipe passed the downhole heat exchanger and the casing size change. Approximately 2.5-cm diameter holes were torch cut in the pipe 2.1 to 3.0 m off the bottom and 4.6 to 6.1 m from the top (Figure 9). The casing was hung from a plate at the casing top – which is about 90 cm below street level. We elected to hang the casing off the bottom, as setting it on the bottom might bury the lower holes in fines sloughed into the bottom, thus preventing the
273 UTILISATION
circulation cell from working (Figure 10). The static water level was about 2.4 m below the surface. Before the top holes were cut, we measured the water temperature inside the promoter pipe as show in Figure 11 the following day. The problem with the well is readily shown, with only about 68oC for the first 46 m and then increasing to 89oC from 69 m to the bottom. Thus, the downhole heat exchanger was only exposed to the cooler temperature which is marginal for this type of installation, and since there was no convection cell, would cool even more with heating demand.
274 UTILISATION
The top holes in the promoter pipe were then cut and the pipe installed. We then measured the water temperature profile the next day and received encouraging results. The promoter pipe was working and providing around 77oC over the entire well depth and obviously creating a convection cell bringing hot water up from the bottom (see Figure 11). Subsequent reading produced similar results a shown in Figure 11. The slight variations are due to variations in heating demand for the building, lower readings on cold days and higher reading on warm days. The readings were taken from March 5 through March 14 (all around 1:00 PM) where the low temperatures were around -2oC and the highs around 10oC.",5 CONCLUSIONS,"The Medical Clinic has since reported very adequate and uniform heat in the building with distribution water temperatures to the forced air heating system varying from 78 to 81oC. Thus, the promoter pipe, as researched and developed in Rotorua, New Zealand, appears to be successful in Klamath Falls in solving a geothermal water disposal problem. Several other well owners are also considering this installation as a solution to their well configuration. Where it may not work is in small diameter wells with several downhole heat exchangers allowing room for only a small diameter promoter pipe. Whether a 2.5- to 5.0-cm diameter pipe will work adequately, has yet to be tested. Future monitoring of the Medical Center well and testing other installation will be undertaken by the Geo-Heat Center in the future. The labor and materials for this installation cost around $10,000. The geothermal heating and domestic hot water systems are estimated to save $7,000/year.",6 ACKNOWLEGEMENTS,"The authors wish to thank the Klamath Medical Clinic for their cooperation in this project and for Pacific Plumbers, Corp of Klamath Falls for providing information on the installation of the promoter and assisting with the measurements.

The DHE eliminates the problem of disposal of geothermal fluid, since only heat is taken from the well. DHEs are used extensive in approximately 600 wells in Klamath Falls, Oregon. Corrosion has been a problem for the DHE pipes, especially at the air-water interface, with the use of cross-linked polyethylene (PEX) pipes currently being investigated to solve this problem. In order to increase the heat output from a well using a DHE, a vertical convection cell is developed by perforating the casing at the bottom of “live water” flow and just below the lowest static water surface. Where these perforations have not been provided, typical of older wells, pumping and dumping water to the storm sewers in Klamath Falls has been utilized. This disposal of geothermal water had lowered well water throughout the City. A City ordinance in 1990 stopped the “pumpers and dumpers” to correct this water level decline thus, alternate solutions had to be found. Using experience from Rotorua, New Zealand with convection promoter pipes, an experimental project with initiated at the Klamath Medical Clinic where a pump had been utilized to increase the vertical temperature in the well and the pumped water wasted to the storm sewer. A 10-cm diameter promoter pipe was installed in the well that had cooled in the upper portion due to lack of vertical circulation after the pump had been shut down. The promoter pipe increased the water temperature in the upper portion of the well and thus the DHE provided adequate heat to the Clinic. This solution for the “pumpers and dumper” will be tried elsewhere in the Klamath Falls area.",None,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MONTHLY NORMALS OF TEMPERATURE, PRECIPITATION, AND HEATING
AND COOLING DEGREE DAYS 1951·80
PREFACE
The climatological normals presented in this publication are based on records for the 30-year period 1951-80, inclusive. Data are assembled by individual States.
Data are presented in the order shown in the title. Units used in this publication are of for temperature and inches for precipitation. Heating and cooling degree day (base 65°F) normals are derived from the monthly normal temperatures using the technique developed by Thom (1), (2). Degree day normals also have been computed to other bases and may be obtained at cost from the National Climatic Center, Asheville, NC 28801-2696.
Normals for National Weather Service Offices and Principal Climatological Stations
A normal of a climatological element is the arithmetic mean computed over a time period spanning three consecutive decades. Homogeneity of instrument exposure and station location is assumed. If no exposure changes have occurred at a station, the normal is estimated by simply averaging the 30 values from the 1951-80 record. Since it is next to impossible to maintain a multiple purpose network of meteorological stations without having exposure changes, it is first necessary to identify and evaluate these changes and then make adjustments for them if necessary.
After the periods of heterogeneity have been determined, adjustments are applied to remove the heterogeneities introduced into the mean. This is done by comparing the record at the base station, for which the normal is desired, to the records at supplementary stations with homogeneous periods which covers the heterogeneous period at the base station. The difference method is applied to the monthly average maximum and minimum temperature and the ratio method to the monthly total precipitation (3). A weighted average of the various partial means of the adjusted and unadjusted record is then prepared to give the normal.

, Normals for Substations Individual station values (by year-month) of average temperature and total precipitation for the 1951-80 period are available at the National Climatic Center, Asheville, North Carolina, and may be obtained in either microfiche or magnetic tape for the cost of duplication. In addition, monthly extremes of precipitation and temperature are included along with the standard deviation of monthly temperatures. The National Climatic Center also prepares special studies of climatological elements to specifications provided by the requesting agency or person. The cost of providing such services is borne by the requester. References 1. Thom, H. C. S., ""The Rational Relationship Between Heating Degree Days and Temperature,"" Monthly Weather Review, Vol. 82, No. I, January 1954. 2. Thom, H. C. S., ""Normal Degree Days Above Any Base by the Universal Truncation Coefficient,"" Monthly Weather Review, Vol. 94. No.7, July 1966. 3. Gerald L. Barger, editor, ""Climatology at Work,"" U.S. Weather Bureau, Washington, DC, 1960. Table Content Precipitation normals less than .005 inch are shown as zero. Monthly normals for February are based on a 28-<1ay month. Station Names Figures and letters following the station name indicate a rural location, and refer to the distance and direction of the station from the nearest post office. WSO, WSMO, and WSFO denote a Weather Service Office, a Meteorological Observatory, and a Forecast Office, respectively. Station elevations are in feet above mean sea level. ""R"" or a ""6"" denotes a recording gage. ""II"" indicates a wind shield is affixed to the gage. Pacific Stations Stations located on islands other than Hawaii generally have short records (i.e., less than 30 years) and did not meet the criteria for computation of normals.

Degree Day Normals The usual arithmetical procedures were not applied to obtain the heating and cooling degree day data. The rational conversion formulse developed by Them (1), (2) allow the properly adjusted mean temperature normals to be converted to degree day normals with uniform consistency. In some cases this procedure will yield a small number of degree day values that are unexpected. These cases occur when the standard deviations are computed from a mixed distribution as frequently occurs during the transition months. The unexpected values are low and unimportant for most applications of degree day data.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The Rational Relationship Between Heating Degree Days and Temperature,",,H.C.S.

Solicitation for Cooperative Agreement -",Hot Dry Rock Geothermal Energy Systems,,Development of a Plant to Produce and Market,,Electric Power or Thermal Energy,,Solicitation Number,DE-SC04-95AL98784,To Prospective Applicants:,"This Solicitation for a Cooperative Agreement is sponsored by the Department of Energy (DOE) Headquarters (HQ), Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EE), Geothermal Division. The Hot Dry Rock Geothermal Energy Systems Development of a Plant to Produce and Market Electric Power (Hot Dry Rock Project [HDR]) is authorized under Public Law 93-410, Geothermal Energy Research, Development, and Demonstration Act of 1974; P.L. 101-575, Solar, Wind, Waste, and Geothermal Power Production Incentives Act of 1990; P.L. 102-486, Energy Policy Act of 1992; and P.L. 95-91, Department of Energy Organization Act.
The mission of the Hot Dry Rock Project is to seek industrial partners to develop a cost-shared, industry-led project. The project will involve constructing a prototype facility to produce and market electric power or heat generated from geothermal energy in hot dry rock.
The major objectives of the project are to entail the installation and operation of a Hot Dry Rock System and the production and marketing of power from the Hot Dry Rock resource. The
primary purpose of the projects is surface plant operation and reservoir evaluation for at least 3 years. In order to accomplish this, it will be necessary that the project generate and market energy and that the revenue stream from power sales be sufficient to pay all operating costs and return a reasonable profit to its operator. It is, therefore, essential that a customer for the power be identified prior to the inception of the project. The specific goals and objectives of this effort are addressed in the solicitation. The period of performance for the project may extend to 7 years.
The Hot Dry Rock Project was initiated in 1974 to undertake the development and implementation of a revolutionary technology to extract useful amounts of energy from a vast geothermal resource: rock at depth that is hot, but which is not in contact with mobile fluid required to convect its thermal energy to the surface. Between 1974 and 1978, a small, manmade geothermal reservoir was created at Fenton Hill, New Mexico. Thermal energy was extracted from this reservoir during a number of circulation tests carried out during 1978- 1980. These early results provided systems at Fenton Hill. Between 1980 and 1986, a much larger, deeper, and hotter Hot Dry Rock reservoir was created. A
prototype surface plant, built to power industry standards, was constructed and mated to this large reservoir over the period 1987-1991. Extensive flow testing of the system was conducted during 1992-1993. The positive results of that flow testing have lead to the development of this solicitation.

The processes of p~vatization and dere~lation, deeply involved the power generation industry, with heavy consequences which are getting more evident every day.
With the opening of the power generation sector to private investment, the business situation has drastically changed. The traditional geothermal Countries, like Indonesia and Philippines, have and are continuing to accelerate the movement towards privatization of the government owned utilities. Existing facilities will become available for purchase and “low cost” generation will be benchmark for future success.
New geothermal projects in the region will be developed only under Independent Power Producer scheme, with a considerable pressure put on private developers towards a reduction of the cost of electricity.
This movement, in turn, is putting pressure on manufactures of power generation equipment, in order to reduce the capital cost.
The reduction of capital cost is a challenge that can be met only through a radical redesign both of the main equipm~t and of the plant c o ~ i ~ a t i o n .
With the today available technologies it is possible to increase the unit size and the internal architecture of the steam turbine, taking advantage of the experience gained fiom the steam turbine for fossil power generation, increasing the last stage blade size, introducing improvements on fluid dynamics, getting as a result more powefil, efficient and cheaper machines.
The simplification of turbine architecture will have beneficial effects on plant c o ~ ~ a t i o n and lay-out, with reduction on cost of civil works and plant ~ ~ ~ c ~ e s .
This paper will give a quick overview on the today possible development of geothermal power generation technology in the direction of reducing plant capital cost and improving plant performances.
The Plant Configuration The traditional geothermal power plant, designed for the electric Utilities, reflects the modes and the operational philosophy in use in the fossil power plant. Therefore the main equipment is housed in buildings, permanent lifting devices are there, everytfung is lighted, ai conditioned, paved, fiunished to cope to the requirements of the plant crew.
Private plant operators are more flexible in accepting nonconventional plant configuration, such as outdoor arrangement of main equipment, limitation of permanent building only to areas where permanent occupancy is needed or where electronic equipment are to be located, use of mobile lifting devices to service the main machinery.
The use of the outdoor concept for a geothermal power plant gives a big push in the direction of reducing the cost of civil works. The little increase in cost of main equipment, due to the need of making them suitable for outdoor location, normally in tropical highly raining areas, is largely compensated by the elimination of the building structures, their foundations, their services (lighting, ventilation, furnishing etc.).
The concept of using mobile lifting equipment is very suitable for a geothmal power plant, which is normally of not big unit rating, if compared with a fossil power plant. Therefore also the heaviest pieces that need to be lifted during the operation of the plant (theoretically the generator stator, but in the reality the steam turbine upper casing with the diaphragms and/or the turbine rotor) can be moved using normal mobile crane equipment.
Another big step in the direction of reducing the cost of civil works is given by the possibility of using steam turbines with either axial, lateral or upward exhaust). With either one of the above options, it is possible to install the steam turbine on a “low” foundation (the so called “flat” solution). This involves the elimination of the traditional turbine pedestal, which is used for both double or single flow downward exhaust (fig. 1). The turbine pedestal is usually the heaviest concrete structure of the whole plant.
The upward exhaust (fig. 2) can be ”flat*’ in either single or double flow turbines, but it implies the use of bigger and heavy cross-over piping.
The most attractive option is obviously the so called “axial exhaust” (fig. 3), because it is the simplest, cheaper and most s ~ a i g h ~ o ~ a r d solution.
hxpd f inch) area ( sq.ft. 1
New applications
This solution involves the use of a single flow architecture machine, otherwise the complication generated from the connection to a single condenser would d e vain the efEort.
A single flow machine will cost 2530% less if compared to a double flow machine of the same rating.
Moreover the single exhaust will give a lot of flexibility in selecting the most suitable plant configut;aton. The new machine will have the generator drive at the inlet side, making the plant designer free to select the most suitable orientation for the exhaust opening.
In this way the g e o t h e ~ l plant, arranged outd~or~ with the turbine-~en~rator based at an elevation of no more than two meters above the ground level, with a minimal requirement of excavations and earth movements, will have a capital cost considerably lower than a traditional one.
This reduction has a very high value in geothermal plants, which are generally located in volcanic areas, with heavy problems of soil compacting capability, seismic design acceleration and availability of inert for concrete.
The Steam Turbines The current practice for the to-day standard size of geothermal steam turbine, rated in the range 40 to 60 MW, is to make them in the “double flow” configuration, due to the limitation generated by the longest last stage blade traditionally used for geothexmal application, which is 650- 660 mm in length.
The main concem for ~~g the length of the last stage blades was the presence of a high moisture content in geothermal steam which, associated to the high tip speed of long blades, could lead to an erosion damage of the rotating blades.
ANSALDO Energia, starting from the considerations listed above, has developed new last LP stages for its geothermal tuibines, using blades directly derived from those used for fossil applications and applying all the countermeasures necessary to avoid the erosion problem due to moisture.
These blades, 660 mm and 850 mm long, with their larger annulus areas allow to answer the requirements listed above, the main requirement being to make it possible unit ratings up to 60 MW in the single flow configuration. Fig. 4 shows lengths and annulus areas of the mentioned blades compared with those most frequently used so far by the Author’s company for geothermal applications.
In fig. 5 are reported data concerning the operating experience of these blades with number of rows in operation, aggregated hours of service and maximum hours experienced by a single row. Several rows have been in service for more than 200.000 hours and all of the rows did not experience failures or replacement.
The experience refers not only to reheat machines but also to straight condensing ones and even to some nuclear turbines at 3000 RPM with a moisture content in LP steam coaaparable to that of geothermal units.
The association of long blades at fill speed in presence of a high moisture content in the steam was well ~ d ~ s t o o d an
widely applied in stearn turbines for combined cycle where the no-need of a regenerative cycle e n c o ~ g e d the application of machine “flat” arrangements and axial discharge to the condenser. The steam turbine could be practically put on the ground as the gas turbine, frequently, in single shaft c o ~ i ~ a t i o n , thus avoiding the high cost for the pedestal, machine house and associated equipment, erection of the rotating equipment.
In fig. 6 is reported the power range attainable in geothermal turbines with three diffkrent last stage blades.
~ . ....
.. .
The study carried out for comparison purpose with three different inlet steam pressures, a fixed condenser pressure (typical of wet cooling tower system in a tropical country) and keeping the annulus velocity in its optimum range, shows the possibility to go over 60 Mw with single flow application and over 120 Mw with the double flow (figures do not reflect, for commercial reasons, exact steam rates attainable in specific projects).
Geothermal turbine with single flow LP exhaust in the most cornon output range of 50-6OMw are then feasible today. They can dischge steam axially to the condenser, thus making the plant not only more economical but also more eficient.
Reason for better efficiency are:
reduced turbine leaving losses as compared with those of a downward exhaust typical of a pedestal mounted machine .
* higher stage efficiency as cornpared with a same rate double flow machine due to better expect ratio of single flow blading.
Moreover there is the indication that very high unit ratings, over 120 Mw, can be reached in double flow configuration with long blades, thus avoiding the need of the high cost tandem compound four flow machines built in the past.
In that case a “flat” arrangement can stil l be pursued with an upward exhaust and cross-over connections to the condenser.
It is worthwhile to spend some words for what concerns the measures against moisture erosion, considering their importance with long blades. They are listed in fig. 7 and aimed at:
reducing water content in the steam before the impact with the last stage blade avoid most of the droplet impact with last rotating blades protect the blades with special surface hardening or the use of “self shielded” material
collection slots in last stage nozzles over-shot last stage diaphragm
Same of these features were already applied to either halfspeed nuclear and full speed geothermal machines (fig. 8 &

The last stage overshot diaphragm is a feature that drives the water flowing as a film in the corner by the fured blade or nozzle and the outer side-wall (fig. 10) over the rotating blade tip avoiding the impact of the droplets with the tip itself as in pervious diaphragms. “his measure has revealed as very effective in controlling erosion.
Leakage control is assured by a sealing strip placed in the blade cover resulting in a good con~bution to turbine efficiency.

Water collection slots in last stage nozzle is a measure taken only in the most critical conditions with stage moisture, outlet pressure, water relative velocity, tip speed that could lead to a high erosion rate. . It consist of hollow nozzles cut with slots in the concave side (fig. 11) to gather the water that tends to concentrate at trailing edge of the nozzle where form the dangerous droplets that impact the moving blades.

The slots connect the nozzle outer surface to the condenser through the hollow nozzle and piping (fig. 12). The pressure drop helps the surface water to the condenser before its concentration in the trailing edge. Direct tests in experimental facility have shown the high effectiveness of this measure.
Besides all the mentioned characteristics, modem geothermal turbines features new generation of blade profiles designed to give better efficiency through the reduction of profie and secondary losses.
Their application can improve the until heat rate by more than 2%.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Conclusion Radical redesign of both main equipment and plant configuration can lead to a consistent reduction of capital cost in geothermal power plants.
A substantial contribution can be given by the steam turbine with the ~pplication of last stage blades longer than those traditionally adopted so far.
Development efforts, experimental tests, operational service together w i a special anti-erosion features, have confirmed their reliability and suitability for geothermal duty.
Steam turbines with longer blades can be made as single flow instead of double flow.
In this case to the intrinsic cost reduction of the machine is to be added that due to the “flat” configuration of the unit which means saving ion civil work, installation and O&M.
Moreover single flow machines vs. double flow ones give better efficiency that can be added to that due to lower exhaust losses when the discharge to the condenser is axial.
In any case with longer blades even double flow machines can become economic in the high output ranges when it can be used instead of a tandem compound four flow turbine. An upward discharge can make them suitable for “flat” arrangement. Side discharge to the condenser is under development (fig. 13).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2004,"Under certain conditions specified in the law, libraries and archives are authorized to furnish a photocopy or other reproduction.

The wetland area was developed in the 1930’s, and has undergone changes that include land clearing, grazing and altering the path of waterways. The Department of Conservation (DoC) embarked on restoring the Waikite Wetland in 2009 which included a land exchange with farmers, fencing, restoring water courses, plantings and weeding.
This study presents the initial results of chemical, physical, microbiological and invertebrate monitoring at the wetland in response to the change in management of the wetland area.",INTRODUCTION,"Rehabilitation of sensitive geothermal ecosystems that have been adversely impacted by development is an emerging area of research. Some forms of development (e.g. land that has been cleared for farming) may be amenable to remediation measures that attempt to restore at least some of the pre-development ecosystem over short to medium time frames (years to decades).
The Waikite Geothermal Field is located in the Waikite Valley, approximately 20 km south of Rotorua, New Zealand (Figure 1). The geothermal field is characterised by up to 47 identified surface features including hot springs, hot lakes, fumaroles, sinter deposits and streams, which range in temperature from 7.7°C to 98.4°C (Glover et al., 1992). The wetland is in the geothermal area and has thermal springs discharging into the southwest corner. This corner currently hosts a range of thermotolerant vegetation and thermophilic micro-organisms.
The wetland area has undergone major hydrological changes in the last 80 years due to development of the land for grazing. Land clearing, grassing, draining the wetland and diverting the Otamakokore Stream (Figure 1) around the wetland are some of the works carried out since the 1930’s to increase the sheep grazing area.
Since 2009, the Department of Conservation (DoC) has embarked on restoring the wetland area. Actions to date include legal protection, invasive plant management, fencing, restorative plantings and restoring the Otamakokore Stream back through the wetland (June, 2009).
This study presents the initial results of physical, chemical and biological surveys in response to restoring the Waikite Wetland. Geothermal inputs into the wetland are also estimated. This study was developed to compliment the work been done by DoC.",METHODS Ground Temperature survey,Ground temperature sites were selected to be in an approximate grid pattern inside and outside of the wetland. Hydrological conditions restricted site access in some parts of the wetland. A GPS location was taken at each site. Temperatures were measured at 1 m depths (where possible) at each site with a Yokogawa TX10 meter connected to type K thermocouple on 18/09/2009.,Physical measurements,"Grab samples of water were collected from five sites (Figure 1) in August, September, November, and December 2009 and in, January, February, April, June and October 2010. Samples were collected following the procedures outlined by Rosen et al. (1999). Water samples were analysed at the Wairakei Analytical Facility. Only chloride (Cl) data will be presented in this paper. Chemistry data from Glover et al., (1992), Mahon (1965) and Waikato Regional Council (2010) was used to supplement the data collected. The electrical conductivity was measured at each site with a Hach HQ40D conductivity meter. The water temperature was measured using a K type thermocouple connected to either a Bontron or Yokogawa meter.
Flow gaugings at sites along the Otamakokore Stream used an OSS-PC1 current meter with measurements made every 10 cm across the stream (measurements were every 20 cm on 25/8/2010). Data were processed using gLog™ software. Flow gaugings at site WE1001 were taken from a small weir constructed with sandbags with a PVC pipe at the base of the dam. The amount of time taken to fill a 15 l bucket with the water flowing through the PVC pipe was recorded five times. An average of the five flow gaugings is reported.",Microbiologi,"aikite wetland

21 - 23 November 2011 Auckland, New Zealand",Microbiological,"With the exception of WKR8 (Figures 1 and 5), no significant change in the microbial population was detected in any of the sampling sites. WKR8 was the only site that showed a major microbial population change across all types of analyses between 08/04/2010 and 28/09/2010. The soil samples at this site in particular showed a distinct reduction in species diversity over time (Figure 5). The change in the microbial population corresponded to an increase of 8°C in the water temperature measured at this site during this time period. The increase in water temperature at this site is probably caused by an increased water flow through a channel dug from the spring to the Otamakokore Stream between 10/06/2010 and 31/08/2010 which lowered the water level in the spring by approximately 5 cm.
Analyses of the water at WKR8 also showed significant decreases in microbial diversity and shifts in resident bacterial and archaeal species. Overall, the microbial population shifted from a community of thermophilic bacterial and archaeal species to a community dominated by archaeal species with the temperature increases. This observation is consistent with thermophilic microbial ecology that Archaea predominate over Bacteria at nearboiling temperatures. No cyanobacteria were detected at this site over the duration of the study. The average temperatures of this spring and associated soils (81.9°C and 85°C respectively) are too hot for photosynthetic
microorganisms and therefore would not have supported cyanobacterial growth.",Macroinvertebrate,"Macroinvertebrate abundance at sites sampled along the Otamakokore Stream is shown in Figure 6. Greatest abundance occurred at OT2 (7380/sample), OT3 (6240/sample) and OT6 (2698/sample) in 2009. In 1999 highest numbers occurred at OT1 (3592/sample) and OT2 (800/sample). At all sites the high numbers resulted from the occurrence of the chironomid midge Tanytarsus.
The macroinvertebrate fauna of the Otamakokore Stream was low in diversity, which is common with the macroinvertebrate fauna recorded from other geothermallyinfluenced water courses. The fauna comprised organisms that are common to non-geothermal waters as well as organisms found only in geothermal ecosystems.
The macroinvertebrate community sampled in 2009 comprised a greater proportion of species found commonly in geothermal waterways. This is largely explained by the loss of macroinvertebrates that are less well-adapted to the characteristics of geothermal waters, rather than an increase in species that occur more commonly in geothermal waters. In part this result is a reflection of the taxonomic penetration at each sampling period. However, it largely reflects the changing geothermal and habitat characteristics resulting from the stream reclamation.
The macroinvertebrate communities dominated by Tanytarsus/Ephydrella occurring at Otamakokore Stream are consistent with the alkali-chloride and bicarbonate geochemical characteristic occurring elsewhere in the Taupo Volcanic Zone (Hunt and Bibby 1992, Boothroyd 2009).

21 - 23 November 2011 Auckland, New Zealand",CONCLUSIONS,"The three sources of water into the Waikite Wetland are identified; the Otamakokore Stream, small springs in the south east corner of the wetland, and the subsurface flows along the southern and eastern margins of the wetland. Geothermal water inputs from within the wetland are estimated to be ~ 14 l s-1.
Monitoring data show that negligible changes in water chemistry and microbial populations have occurred in the wetland since monitoring began after management changes were implemented. Comparisons of the macroinvertebrate populations between 1999 and 2009 show that there were less taxa and also an increase in species that occur more commonly in geothermal waters in 2009. This is associated with redirecting the Otamakokore Stream back into the wetland.",ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS,"The authors would like to thank the Department of Conservation, Rodger Bedford (Landcorp farm manager), Peter Booth (Landcorp), Russell West (Rotorua Farm and Industrial Pumping Ltd) and bore owners for their cooperation and assistance.

Several geothermal springs discharge into the wetland in the southeast corner providing a source of hot water into the wetland and an opportunity for a geothermal ecosystem to develop. The wetland area was developed in the 1930’s, and has undergone changes that include land clearing, grazing and altering the path of waterways. The Department of Conservation (DoC) embarked on restoring the Waikite Wetland in 2009 which included a land exchange with farmers, fencing, restoring water courses, plantings and weeding. This study presents the initial results of chemical, physical, microbiological and invertebrate monitoring at the wetland in response to the change in management of the wetland area. INTRODUCTION Rehabilitation of sensitive geothermal ecosystems that have been adversely impacted by development is an emerging area of research. Some forms of development (e.g. land that has been cleared for farming) may be amenable to remediation measures that attempt to restore at least some of the pre-development ecosystem over short to medium time frames (years to decades). The Waikite Geothermal Field is located in the Waikite Valley, approximately 20 km south of Rotorua, New Zealand (Figure 1). The geothermal field is characterised by up to 47 identified surface features including hot springs, hot lakes, fumaroles, sinter deposits and streams, which range in temperature from 7.7°C to 98.4°C (Glover et al., 1992). The wetland is in the geothermal area and has thermal springs discharging into the southwest corner. This corner currently hosts a range of thermotolerant vegetation and thermophilic micro-organisms. The wetland area has undergone major hydrological changes in the last 80 years due to development of the land for grazing. Land clearing, grassing, draining the wetland and diverting the Otamakokore Stream (Figure 1) around the wetland are some of the works carried out since the 1930’s to increase the sheep grazing area. Since 2009, the Department of Conservation (DoC) has embarked on restoring the wetland area. Actions to date include legal protection, invasive plant management, fencing, restorative plantings and restoring the Otamakokore Stream back through the wetland (June, 2009).

INTRODUCTION,"Since the drilling cost accounts for a large part of geothermal development in Japan, cost reduction of drilling has been requested as one of the most important tasks.
However, constraining such requirements, we are obliged to carry out directional drilling under the following conditions, which limit effective drilling: - Underground conditions: Hard fractured formation,
- Surface conditions: National parks, mountainous areas, steep topography, very limited surface space for drilling rigs.
In order to improve drilling efficiency under such situations, NEDO started the development of a high temperature MWD system, and a drilling support system for geothermal wells in 1991. The drilling support system consists of the directional control support system, and well evaluation support system.
As one part of the directional control support system, a well trajectory prediction system has been developed and tested (Ujo et al., 1997). Main functions of this trajectory prediction system are: well trajectory prediction while drilling in rotary and DHM drilling, design of adequate BHA drilling parameters, and evaluation of the geological effect on well trajectory.
MWD must result in effective directional drilling. However, effective directional drilling with MWD operation should be based on proper directional well trajectory planning, and adequate BHA and drilling parameter design. Regarding geological effect for well trajectory, as the effect in geothermal wells is much stronger than for oil wells, the study and improvement for this problem must be considered.
Based upon this goal, we have developed, tested and improved the system to predict well trajectory of rotary drilling, conventional DHM and steerable DHM motor drilling in geothermal wells, which can be operated not only for the NEDO high temperature MWD system but also for conventional directional drilling with MWD or steering tools.","2. WELL TRAJECTORY PREDICTION SYSTEM, A CASE STUDY AND IMPROVEMENT",,2.1 Outline of the System,"As part of the drilling support system, a well trajectory prediction system has been developed considering field data and experiences of geothermal directional drilling in Japan (refer to Fig. 1). This system was designed for adequate directional control operations in order to realize improvement of drilling efficiency. For such purposes it has the functions of well trajectory prediction, and design of BHA and drilling parameters for conventional DHM drilling, rotary drilling and steerable DHM drilling.
Program for DHM Drilling A static BHA model program for DHM drilling has been developed based on the equations of equilibrium for BHA to calculate the force acting on bit (Jogi et al., 1988). These equations of equilibrium for BHA have the following form:
Ta GJ

where, EI is the bending stiffness; GJ is the torsional stiffness; Ta is torque on the bit (TOB); W is weight on bit (WOB); wI is effective weight per inch of BHA including buoyancy due to drill mud; β is angle of inclination; and ωθ is the angle of twist per unit length. The proper boundary conditions for the above equations are omitted.
Also, a drilling ahead criterion for calculating the wellpath is developed based upon Ho's definition (Ho, 1987) (refer to Fig. 2). The angle change between well trajectory and drill path is written as:
)(

b L

F i=θ
      += − )( )( 1tan ba b L bbt F F iθγ (2)
where, γ is the angle of drill ahead change (angle between well trajectory and drill ahead); θbt is the angle between bit axis and well trajectory; ib is bit anisotropy; Fa
(b) is force on bit along the bit direction; FL
(b) is force on bit; force on bit perpendicular to the bit access direction.
Program for Rotary Drilling If the rotary speed of drilling does not reach the resonant RPM of the drill string, the above-mentioned theory for static BHA model can be applied for a rotary drilling. However, if the rotary speed of BHA reaches the resonant RPM of drill string, lateral motion of drill collar would occur and it becomes impossible to apply static BHA model. And, in this case, drilling itself becomes more hazardous and downhole tool problems would occur.
To avoid such limitations and problems, we developed the program to find resonant RPM during rotary drilling based on Yew's equations (Yew and Zhang, 1994) as below:
( )    −++−= 2342 4 2 1 WnTnEInm m res iiiµω (3)
where:

ωres is the resonant RPM; EI is the bending stiffness; m is the unit weight of drill collar; µ is mud viscosity; T is torque on bit; W is weight on bit; and L is length of drill collar.",2.2 Case Study and Improvement of the System,"Tests and parameter studies of the system were carried out for effects of bent sub angle, tool face angle, drilling parameter, BHA configuration and resonant RPM (Nakashima et al.,
1995).
After the above studies several case studies have been carried out using actual directional drilling data in Japanese geothermal fields.
Case Study for DHM Drilling Figure 3 is an example of comparison of the simulated well trajectory by the prediction system and observed actual well trajectory in geothermal drilling with DHM and bent sub; which shows good agreement. The simulated well trajectory by the prediction system was calculated by inputting actual BHA, drilling parameter, tool face orientation of bent sub that were recorded in geothermal drilling. In other cases, the simulated and actual well trajectories also show mostly good agreement. Therefore, it is expected that the well trajectory prediction system will be able to improve efficiency of directional drilling with DHM at least, as the system achieves more adequate selection of BHA, drilling parameter and tool face orientation.
Case Study for Rotary Drilling and Improvement We have done several case studies for rotary drilling using directional drilling data in different geothermal areas in Japan. At the first stage, we used the fixed bit anisotropy (ib) assumed by bit test data, and in most cases the agreement between the simulated and actual well trajectories are not as good as DHM drilling. Especially in some cases which have complicated or strong geological tendency, distinct differences between the simulated and actual well trajectories were observed (refer to Fig. 4).
Through these case studies, we have concluded it is necessary to consider both bit and rock anisotropy for applying the prediction system for rotary drilling. We have therefore introduced the definition for direction of drilling with anisotropy index of both rock and bit (Ho, 1987) into the program as follows.

Although it is expected that this theory improved the accuracy of the simulation of well trajectory prediction, there has been a limitation to the application because it is not possible to acquire actual downhole anisotropy index of rock and bit for input to the system before drilling. Based on this situation, we have developed the new program to calculate anisotropy index of rock and bit reflecting downhole condition by inversion technique and Ho's definition using actual drilling data, and tested to apply these indexes to the prediction of other wells. The actual well trajectory (survey data) is the result reflected by BHA configuration and drilling parameter relating to BHA equilibrium equations, and definitions for direction of drilling with anisotropy index (bit and rock). By applying inversion (method of least squares) with the above equations and actual data, we tried to calculate anisotropy index. Figure 5 shows our concept of calculation and application of anisotropy index for drilling of new well. We consider that anisotropy index calculated with prior well data will be able to improve the well trajectory prediction of a new well, if the distance between old and new wells is close and geological tendency is expected to be similar.
Figure 6 shows an example of application and the results of the above method. These two wells (WD-1a and WD-1b) were drilled by NEDO in the Kakkonda geothermal area with different rotary BHAs and DHM assembly, respectively. In this study, first we calculated bit and rock anisotropy index of the first well before side track (WD-1a) with inverse program and actual drilling data including BHA configuration and drilling parameters for each section. Then, we carried out the well trajectory prediction of the second well (WD-1b after sidetrack) by prediction system with drilling data of this well (WD-1b) and anisotropy index of the first well (WD-1a). In this study a distinct difference was observed between simulated well trajectory without anisotropy index and actual well trajectory; which was corresponded to complex geological structure. On the other hand, the simulated result with anisotropy index shows good agreement with actual well trajectory as anisotropy indexes of these two wells were similar. We consider it possible to improve the accuracy of well trajectory prediction with the program even in rotary drilling, if we have data from nearby well locations to apply for calculating anisotropy index for a new well. We are scheduled to carry out case studies using other geothermal drilling data to find points to be improved.",3. PRELIMINARY STUDY OF GEOLOGICAL,"EFFECT IN GEOTHERMAL DRILLING
Many qualitative discussions had been made regarding the well trajectory control problems due to geological effect in directional drilling for many years. We tried to find what happened downhole during directional drilling by using
possible simulated numerical data as preliminary study for this subject.
A distinct correlation has been observed between calculated bit anisotropy indexes and geological boundary as confirmed by drilling in WD-1a. Especially, at the following TD (total drilling depth) and geological boundary of WD-1a, bit anisotropy index of more than 0.7 was observed as a distinct correlation:
- TD approx. 2300m: Boundary between Tertiary Formation (Obonai Formation, acidic tuff and andestic tuff) and Old-Granites (intrusive rock) - TD approx. 2720m: Boundary between Pre-Tertiary Formation (sandstone, acidic tuff and slate) and OldGranites (intrusive rock) - TD approx. 2850m: Boundary between Pre-Tertiary Formation (sandstone, acidic tuff and slate) and NewGranites (Quaternary)
Near the above depths (TD), bit anisotropy index: [Drilling rate in bit's lateral direction / Drilling rate in bit's axial direction] indicates larger values compared to other sections. It is considered that force on bit perpendicular to the bit direction becomes much larger at the geological boundary which seems to have large physical difference as relating to intrusive rock, for example, and it makes drilling rate in the bit lateral direction much bigger.
On the other hand, large bit anisotropy index observed below TD approx. 2900m is not related to geological boundary. We assume that this larger value compared with the Tertiary formation might be caused by physical heterogeneity of the New-Granite such as boundary permeability; although further study with logging and other data is necessary.
Regarding other possible geological effect such as bedding and fracture; although data to confirm scale, dip and direction is limited, we are trying to evaluate such effects and relations to rock anisotropy index with data as FMI or BHTV logging.
From the standpoint of directional drilling, information of the geological boundary relating to large bit anisotropy index is very important and should be strongly considered. Next drilling step including BHA (rotary or DHM, hold, build and drop BHA) should be considered based upon not only the drilling plan and situation but also prediction of geological effect.
From the standpoint of well evaluation, there is the possibility for bit and rock anisotropy index to be calculated from directional drilling data to support geological evaluation; although more detailed study is necessary.",4. CONCLUSIONS,"The well trajectory prediction system, for both well trajectory prediction and design of BHA system, one of the drilling support systems, has been developed, tested and improved. Regarding DHM drilling, as well trajectory calculated by the original program was consistent with actual data, we considered that the well trajectory prediction system could support the efficient DHM drilling. On the other hand, regarding rotary drilling, as well trajectory had the tendency to be affected by not only force acting on the bit, but also
geological effect, the original program without considering geological effect was not adequate for well trajectory prediction. For estimating and rejecting such effects, we developed a new program to calculate bit & rock anisotropy index by inversion method and tested it using actual rotary drilling data. We found it possible to improve the well trajectory prediction by applying this method. Also, strong correlation was observed between bit anisotropy index calculated by the inversion program and geological boundary confirmed by drilling. It is considered that force on bit perpendicular to the bit direction becomes much larger at the geological boundary. Therefore, the information of geological boundary relating to large bit anisotropy index is very important and should be more closely examined for directional drilling.",ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS,"The authors wish to thank the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) for permission to present the results obtained in the development of the MWD system for geothermal wells, within the New Sunshine Project of MITI, Japan.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Prediction of drilling trajectory in directional well via a new rock/bit interaction model.

This system was designed to be applied for DHM (down hole motor) drilling and for rotary drilling in geothermal areas. Computer programs of the system have been developed based on equations of equilibrium for BHA (bottom hole assembly) (Jogi et al., 1988) to calculate the force acting on a bit, definition to determine the direction of drilling (Ho, 1987) and equation to find resonant RPM (Yew and Zhang, 1994). We verified the program using actual directional drilling data in a geothermal area. Regarding DHM drilling, as well trajectories calculated by the program were mostly consistent with actual field data, we considered that this program could support efficient DHM drilling. However, in some cases for rotary drilling the results from the program were not consistent with actual data. We considered the actual well trajectory in rotary drilling had the tendency to be affected not only by force acting on the bit, but also geological effects. For estimating and rejecting geological effects, we developed a new program to calculate bit and rock anisotropy index by an inversion method and tested it using actual rotary drilling data. We found it possible to improve the well trajectory prediction by applying bit and rock anisotropy index. We have examined such geological effects with this program using drilling and geological data of deep geothermal wells (WD-1a and WD-1b) drilled by NEDO. In this study, anisotropy indexes of these adjacent two wells (WD-1a and WD-1b) were similar. And, strong correlation was observed between bit anisotropy index calculated by the inversion program with actual directional drilling data and geological boundary as confirmed by drilling. Well trajectory was seriously affected by geological effect at the geological boundary. If we can estimate the geology of a new well from other nearby well data, it will be possible to improve drilling efficiency by this system. Next our task is to study other geological and downhole factors affecting well trajectory and reflect such study results to improvement of geothermal drilling.",Microsoft Word ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

INTRODUCTION,"In the quantification of the complex structure of fracture networks, fractal geometry has been in use since the first study was reported (Barton and Larsen, 1985). Fractal geometry is useful to quantify the size scaling or scale dependency of fracture systems. It also enables us to generate representative patterns synthetically (Barnsley, 1988).
The quantification of natural fracture patterns through fractal geometry is based upon the estimation of a non-integer number called a fractal dimension, D. The most common method applied for this purpose is the box counting technique (Barton and Larsen, 1985; Barton, 1995). La Pointe (1988) introduced another methodology to measure the fractal dimension of the matrix block distribution instead of the box counting method. Yamamato et al. (1993) measured the mass fractal dimension by investigating the number-radius relationship and obtained the fractal dimension of the distribution of fracture midpoints that represents fracture density.
The hydraulic conductivity of a fractured network is the property that represents scale-dependent behavior (Chang and Yortsos, 1990; Acuna and Yortsos, 1995). In the quantification of this scale dependency, a reliable estimate of fractal fracture properties is required. Several properties of a fracture network affect its hydraulic behavior. These are typically fracture density, length, orientation, connectedness and aperture. In a fractal description of fracture networks, the box counting technique is commonly applied to obtain the box dimension of the network. This technique provides a quantification of how space filling the fracture pattern is. In a sense, the box dimension implies how intense the fracture network is. It was observed that increasing fracture density gives rise to an increase in the box counting dimension (Acuna and Yortsos, 1995). However, the density of the fracture network may not be enough to represent the hydraulic properties of the network completely. Therefore, measurement of other fractal properties should be implemented. This sometimes requires an application of different measurement techniques, other than box counting, that are more suitable to measure the fractal dimension of different fracture properties. This issue has been discussed by La Pointe (1988) who proposed a fractal measurement method that honors the connectedness of the fracture network.
The main emphasis in the present study is to evaluate the fractal properties of natural fracture patterns. Fracture properties such as density, connectedness and length are considered primarily and the fractal dimension of their distributions is measured by different methods. Natural outcrop fracture patterns from the geothermal fields in southwestern Turkey are used in this attempt. Particular attention is devoted to the fracture properties that might directly influence the hydraulic behavior of fracture networks. In fact the study is intended to be extended in that direction and the observations on fractal behavior will be used later to assess re-injection applications.",2. CHARACTERIZATION OF NATURAL FRACTURE PATTERNS THROUGH FRACTAL GEOMETRY AT,"DIFFERENT SCALES
Babadagli
The analysis of fracture patterns collected at different levels from giga to micro scales was performed. This provides quite a large interval to determine the scale invariance range of natural fracture structures. This is an important issue in modeling the hydraulic behavior of the network. Once the conductivity is determined for a scale then it is used to obtain the one at higher scales as long as the network represents scale invariance in this particular range (Chang and Yortsos, 1990). When limited data and size are available such as core or log records, one has to extend this information to a larger scale, which is the grid-size level of numerical models used for performance estimation studies. Hence, the fractal behavior of a fracture network needs to be defined for this type of application.
To identify the fractal relationship between scales, fracture network maps of very broad scale range were analyzed by box counting. These maps are of a region in southwestern Turkey where high enthalpy geothermal reservoirs are located.",2.1 Preparation of fracture trace maps,"Data used throughout the study were collected at different scales. Aerial photographs of the region provided an extensive view of fracture patterns at giga scale. The fracture patterns shown in Fig. 1 were created using aerial photographs of Kizildere and Germencik geothermal fields, which have the highest capacity in the region. In the preparation of fracture maps all the fractures were included except the major faults. Data at a lower scale were collected in the field at different outcrops representing the production formations of different geothermal fields. The main rock in most of these reservoirs is marble.
Some of the fracture traces obtained at this scale and used throughout the fractal analysis are given in Fig. 2. These patterns were generated using an image processing application. In the mapping study, all the fractures were included regardless of their size and type. The aperture of the fractures was not taken into account. Fracture patterns were also obtained at lower scales. Rock samples collected during the field trip were photographed and fracture traces were generated from these photos. Fig. 3 illustrates one of the fracture patterns generated using rock photographs. Thin sections of these samples were used to analyze the fractal characteristic at micro scale. Fig. 4 shows a fracture map generated from the thin section of the rock sample shown in Fig. 3.",2.2 Fractal analysis,"The box-counting technique was applied to fracture networks at four different scales to measure the fractal dimension. The number of the box size, r, was selected as higher than five to minimize the error due to straight line fitting to data. Then, the fractal dimension was calculated according to the following relationship:
DrN −∝ (1)
where N is the number of boxes filled with fractures, r is the size of the square box and D is the fractal dimension of the fracture network.
Scale – I (km level – giga scale)
The box-counting technique was applied to two images shown in Fig. 1. The fractal dimensions were obtained as 1.575 and 1.583 for the Germencik and Kizildere Fields, respectively. As seen, the values are very close to each other.
Scale – II (m level – mega scale)
Mega scale study was performed on the fracture traces obtained from fifteen outcrop photos of the producing formations. Some of the fracture traces are given in Fig. 2. The range of the values is provided in Table 1 (first row) for all samples. It was visually observed that the higher the box counting fractal dimension, the denser the fracture network.
Scale – III (cm level – macro scale)
Fractal dimensions of the fracture traces obtained from the rock samples (Fig. 3 shows one of them) were measured by the box counting technique. The range of the fractal dimensions for seven patterns is given in Table 2 (first column).
Scale – IV (µm level - micro scale)
The same procedure was applied to the micro scale fracture traces obtained from the thin section of the samples taken from the rock pieces. Fig. 4 illustrates one of the thin section fracture maps. The range of the fractal dimension values obtained are given in Table 2 (second column) for seven samples. The fractal dimension values are significantly lower than the values of higher scales and close to unity. This can be attributed to a much lower density and complexity of fracture network at the micro scale. Having a fractal dimension very close to unity implies that the network approaches an Euclidean character and at this scale level (thin section) the fracture network system loses its fractal feature.
The box counting dimension values at different scales are plotted in Fig. 5 for the Kizildere Field. As the scale increases, more complex networks were obtained, as can be observed through Figs. 1 to 4, resulting in an increase in fractal dimension. This is an important issue because knowledge of the scale limits in self-similarity is a critical point in data preparation for simulation studies. Note that during the application of the technique, the box counting measurements were performed for the different parts of the fracture pattern. It was observed that the values were in accordance with the fractal dimension of the whole image.",3. FRACTAL ANALYSIS OF DIFFERENT FRACTURE PROPERTIES AT MEGA SCALE,"The fractal characteristics of different fracture network properties that can affect the conductivity of the networks have been examined by applying different methods. Fractal geometry provides a single number to characterize or identify the complex structure of network quantitatively. However, different methodologies may yield different dimension values for the same fracture property. Also, different fracture properties may reflect different fractal dimension even though the same methodology is applied.
Babadagli
Fractal geometry also provides the incorporation of the scale effect into the hydraulic behavior of fractured rocks. In this case, the reliable estimation of the fractal dimension is essential for accuracy. In this section, different fracture properties such as fracture density, length, and connectedness that affect the hydraulic behavior of the network will be considered.",3.1 Methods applied to measure the fractal dimension of different fracture properties,"The first issue that will be considered in this analysis is the fracture network property that should be analyzed to assess the hydraulic behavior of a fracture network. The fracture density, for instance, is a strong function of conductivity. However, if a percolating network never exists, no matter how dense the fracture network is, the network will never conduct. Thus, the connectedness is another critical property of the network as related to the conductivity. The fractal dimensions of different network properties that are pertinent to the hydraulic behavior of network are measured and evaluated using different methods.
Box dimension
The box counting technique is commonly applied to measure the fractal dimension of a fracture network (Barton and Larsen, 1985; Sammis et al. 1991; Chiles and de Marsily, 1993). The procedure, explained before, was applied using the correlation given in Eq. 1 for the fracture patterns at mega scale. The range of the values is given in Table 1. All patterns represent fractal characteristics with a good correlation coefficient of straightline fitting and the fractal dimensions obtained are between 1.14 and 1.52. During the measurements all fractures are included in counting whether they are a part of the percolating network or not.
Note that what is measured in this application is how space filling the fracture network is. As mentioned earlier, it was also observed that increasing fracture density causes an increase in the fractal dimension of the network (Acuna and Yortsos, 1995; Barton, 1995) and the fracture density has an influence on the fracture network conductivity. However, the fractal dimension obtained by the box counting method is limited in evaluating the network conductivity (La Pointe, 1988). Many other fracture network properties that may affect the network conductivity should be evaluated as well.
Another fractal evaluation method is to measure the mass dimension (Feder, 1988). The sandbox technique that is commonly used to measure the mass fractal dimension (Bunde and Havlin, 1995) has been applied for this purpose. The fractal dimension values corresponding to different fracture network properties are compared.
Mass dimension (distribution of fracture mid-points, intersection points and number of fractures)
In this methodology, different size circles or squares with the same origin are selected. Then the number of points, N(r) is counted in the square or circle. If the system represents fractal characteristic, the plot of number of points, N(r) vs. the size of the square, r on a log-log paper would yield a straight line and the slope will give the mass fractal dimension according to the following relationship:
DrrN ∝)( (2)
Squares were used in this study and the number of points within each square was counted for seven different size squares. This method has been applied first for mid-point maps and then for the intersection point maps. As an example, midpoint and intersection point distributions of two samples are given in Fig. 6. Notice that we considered fractures intersecting at least one other fracture. This fracture may not be a part of percolating cluster. The range of the sand box dimensions is tabulated for both mid and intersection points of fractures in
Table 1 (rows two and three).
Another property of fracture networks that represents scale invariance, i.e., fractal feature, is its density. The fracture density can be defined as total number of fractures per unit area. The scaling of this property was examined for the same fracture traces at mega scale. The total number of fractures per unit area was counted for different size squares. All the fractures were included in the counting procedure even if some of their parts are out of the square. It should also be mentioned that the fracture length has been defined throughout the analysis as a fracture whose ends are either open or intersected by another fracture. The range of the fractal dimensions is given in Table 1 (row 4). In all measurements, the same region of fracture networks has been selected as in the box counting method.",3.2 Comparison of the fractal dimensions of different properties,"The distribution of mid points and number of fractures per unit area are a measure of the fracture intensity. Both mid point and number of fractures per unit area measure the fractal dimension of fracture density but the fractal dimension of mid point distribution yields notably higher values. This can be attributed to the fracture length. In fact, the fractal dimension of mid point distribution is independent of the fracture length as opposed to counting the number of fractures per unit area. For mid point and intersection point distributions, the fractal dimension values are consistent since most of the fractures intersect each other resulting in similar distribution maps of mid and intersection points.
Acuna and Yortsos (1995) observed that, for both self similar and self affine synthetic fracture networks, box counting and fracture length distribution dimensions are highly consistent. Kranz (1994) computed correlation and box counting dimensions of eight fracture mid point and end point maps of natural fracture patterns. His comparative study shows that the correlation and box counting dimensions differ significantly.",4. DISCUSSION,"Inconsistencies between fractal dimensions of the same fracture properties obtained through different methods were observed. This can be attributed to different fracture characteristics such as fracture length and orientation. It is arguable to use the mass dimension of mid point distribution or intersection point distribution as an alternative to fractal dimension of the number of fractures per unit area.
Babadagli
For a fracture network to be conductive there should be a spanning cluster to percolate. In order to satisfy this condition Barton (1995) suggested that the box dimension should be over 1.35. Although it was observed in this study that the box counting fractal dimensions of the images at mega scale (the scale at which Barton generated the fracture maps) are mostly over 1.35 and a percolating cluster exists, more experimentation is needed to verify this number.
The major issue raised by these analyses is which methodology should be applied in determination of the fractal dimension and which fracture property should be measured with respect to the hydraulic behavior of a fracture network. The above comparative study emphasizes and shows the importance of this issue. But, it is obvious that more research is required to find a solid answer.",5. CONCLUSIONS,"An extensive fractal analysis of natural fracture patterns collected from the outcrops of producing geothermal reservoirs in southwestern Turkey was performed. The descending behavior of fractal dimension with scale was identified for a very wide range of scale. Different properties of natural outcrop fracture patterns at mega scale, such as fracture density and connectedness, represented fractal behavior, but the comparative study revealed that the different measurement techniques might yield significantly different fractal dimensions. The alternative to mid point distribution is the fractal dimension of intersection point distribution, that considers the connectedness and the fractal dimension of the number of fractures per unit area. But, the fractal dimension of the number of fractures per unit area considerably differed from that of both mid and intersection point distribution. The values of mid and intersection point distributions were observed as consistent because most fractures intersected each other and part of the percolating network.

INTRODUCTION,"Iceland is a country of 290,000 people, located on the MidAtlantic Ridge. It is mountainous and volcanic, with much precipitation. The geographical peculiarities lead to a situation where geothermal and hydropower are abundant. During the course of the 20th century Iceland changed from being among Europe’s poorest countries, dependent upon peat and imported coal for its energy, to a country with a high living standard where practically all stationary energy and about 72% of the primary energy comes from indigenous renewable sources (54% geothermal, 18% hydropower). The rest is imported fossil fuel that is used for fishing and transportation. The energy use per capita in Iceland is among the highest in the world and the proportion of this provided by renewable energy sources is greater than in other countries. Nowhere else doe’s geothermal energy play a greater role in energy supply. Iceland is among those nations with the highest utilization of this energy resource. Almost three-quarters of the population live in the southwestern part of the country, where geothermal resources are abundant.
Despite the fact that Iceland possesses extensive unexploited energy reserves, these are not unlimited. Only very rough estimates are available on the size of these energy reserves, resulting in considerable uncertainty when it comes to assessing to what extent they can be harnessed with regard to what is technically possible, cost-efficient, and environmentally desirable. The estimated figures generally proposed for hydropower potential are 30 TWh annually, and for electricity production from geothermal resources 20 TWh annually, totaling 50 TWh per year. This is after deducting the resources, which are unlikely to be developed for environmental reasons. In 2003, electricity production in Iceland amounted to around 17% of this
estimated harnessable energy. Current utilization of geothermal energy for heating and other direct uses is considered to be only a small fraction of what this resource can provide.",2. GEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND,"Iceland is a geologically young country that lies on one of the major fault lines in the earth’s crust, the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. This is the boundary between the North American and Eurasian tectonic plates. It is one of the few places on earth where you can see an active spreading ridge above sea level with the two plates moving apart about 1 to 2 cm per year. As a result of its location Iceland is one of the most tectonically active places on earth with a large number of volcanoes and hot springs. Earthquakes are frequent but rarely cause serious damage. More than 200 volcanoes are situated on the island and at least 30 of them have erupted in historic times. The most famous of the volcanoes is Hekla (1,491 m).
The geothermal resources in Iceland are closely associated with the country’s volcanism. The high-temperature resources are located within the active volcanic zone running through the country from southwest to northeast, while the low- about 250 separate low-temperature areas with temperature resources are mostly in the areas flanking the active zone. To date over 600 hot springs (temperature over 20°C) have been located. There exist moreover at least 26 high-temperature areas with steam fields. The hightemperature areas are directly linked to the active volcanic systems.",3. OVERVIEW OF GEOTHERMAL UTILIZATION,"As has previously been mentioned, geothermal sources account for just over half of Icelanders’ primary energy needs. From the earliest times, geothermal energy has been used for bathing and washing. Late in the 19th century, experiments began with utilizing geothermal energy in market gardening; and early in the 20th century geothermal sources were first used to heat greenhouses. Around the same time, utilization of geothermal energy for heating swimming pools and buildings began; and today space heating is the largest component in direct use of geothermal energy in Iceland.
Figure 2 gives a breakdown of the utilization of geothermal energy in 2001. These percentages are for energy utilized rather than primary energy. Direct use of geothermal energy that year, i.e. for heating, totaled around 23,800 terajoules (TJ), which corresponds to 6,600 GWh. In addition, electricity production amounted to 1,451 GWh. As Figure 2 shows, the 60% share of space heating was by far the greatest, followed by electricity production, accounting for 18%.",4. SPACE HEATING,"Utilization of geothermal energy for space heating on a large scale began with the laying of hot water piping from the hot springs of Laugardalur in Reykjavík in 1930. The formal operations of Reykjavík District Heating (now Reykjavík Energy) began in 1943. Following the oil price hikes of the 1970s, the government took the initiative in expanding district heating utilities, with the result that the share of geothermal energy in space heating increased from 43% in 1970 to 87% in 2002. This development is illustrated in Figure 3.
In recent years, utilization of geothermal energy for space heating has increased mainly as a result of the population increase in the capital area. Most prominent among recent district heating utilities in towns is that of Stykkishólmur, West Iceland, which came into service at the end of 1999. A heating utility at Drangsnes in Northwest Iceland was taken into service at about the same time, and in the town of Budardalur and the surrounding districts of West Iceland about a year later. In addition, a number of small heating utilities have been established in rural areas. There are some 200 small, rural utilities of this type in Iceland. As the result of changing settlement patterns, and the continuing search for geothermal sources in the so-called “cold” areas of
Iceland, the share of geothermal energy in space heating is expected to increase to 92% in the next few decades.
In recent years there have been changes in the ownership structure of many district heating systems in Iceland. The larger companies have either bought or merged with some of the smaller systems. Also it is getting increasingly common to run both district heating and electricity distribution in one municipally owned company. This development should be viewed in connection with the process of deregulation in the electricity market going on in Iceland and the expected increased competition in the energy market in the future.
The Eastern part of Iceland is an area with low geothermal activity and only one district heating system in operation (Egilstaðir). Geothermal exploration in recent years has resulted in a well with sufficient 70°C hot water close to the village Eskifjordur, which has about 1,000 inhabitants. A geothermal district heating system for Eskifjörður is now under preparation.
I spite of intensive geothermal exploration in W-Iceland it has until now not succeeded to find hot water close enough to the village Grundarfjörður (900 inhabitants) to build a district heating system in an economical way. A new bridge crossing a fjord on the distance between Grundarfjörður and a potential well will change this by reducing the transmission pipeline length from 20 to 10 km. The realization of the project is now under preparation.",4.1 Reykjavík,"Reykjavík Energy (Orkuveita Reykjavíkur) was established in 1999 by the merger of Reykjavik District Heating and Reykjavik Electricity. The company is responsible for distribution and sale of both hot water and electricity as well as the waterworks in the city. The total number of employees is 492 and the turnover in 2003 was 183 million US$.
District heating in Reykjavík began in 1930 when some official buildings and about 70 private houses received hot water from geothermal wells close to the old thermal springs in Reykjavík. Reykjavik District Heating (now Reykjavík Energy) was formally established in 1943 when production of hot water from the Reykir field, 17 km from the city, started. Reykjavík Energy is by far the largest of the 26 municipally owned geothermal district heating system in Iceland. It utilizes low-temperature areas within and in the vicinity of Reykjavik as well as the hightemperature field at Nesjavellir, about 27 km away. Today
it serves about 180,000 people or practically the whole population in Reykjavik and six neighboring communities, see table 1.
Table 1: Reykjavík Energy – district heating 2003
Number of people served 179,085 Volume of houses served 42,607,000 m3 Water temperature at user end 75°C Number of wells in use 62 Installed capacity 830 MWt Peak load 2003 593 MWt Total pipe length 2,157 km Water delivered 59,600,000 m3/year
During the past few years Reykjavik Energy has been expanding by taking over several district heating systems in the SW part of the country. Some of them are small systems in rural areas but others are among the largest and oldest geothermal district heating systems in the country. In 2000 they bought the municipally owned district heating system in the village Þorlákshöfn with about 1,400 inhabitants. It is still operated as a separate company, Hitaveita Þorlákshafnar.
Hitaveita Akraness and Borgarfjarðar had been serving the towns Akranes and Borgarnes in W-Iceland with geothermal hot water since 1979 when they merged with Reykjavík Energy on 1st of January of 2002. About 7,000 inhabitants live in the area served by this district heating system.
The third of the main district heating systems in Iceland taken over by Reykjavik Energy in the last years is Hitaveita Hveragerðis which serves about 1,700 inhabitants. From 1st of September 2004 it is owned by Reykjavík Energy. All of these systems that Reykjavík Energy has taken over are separate systems within a radius of 50 km from Raykjavík. The tariffs have been changed to be the same as in Reykjavík and in some cases this has led to considerable reduction in heating costs for the consumers.",4.2 Suðurnes,"Hitaveita Suðurnesja (Sudurnes Regional Heating) owns the co-generation power plant at Svartsengi on Reykjanes peninsula, about 50 km SW of Reykjavík. The plant has been in operation since 1977. It serves four communities on the Reykjanes peninsula with totally about 17,000 inhabitants with hot water and electricity. In addition to that the plant serves about 25,000 inhabitants in Hafnarfjordur and other communities in the vicinity of Reykjavik with electricity. In 2002 Hitaveita Suðurnesja merged with Bæjarveitur Vestmannaeyja, which supply 4,400 inhabitants of the Westman Islands with electricity and district heating based on electrical boilers.
During the last few years Hitaveita Suðurnesja has been preparing a new power plant at Reykjanes for electricity production. This will be discussed further in chapter 10.6.",4.3 Akureyri,"Akureyri is a town of 16,000 inhabitants located in the central N-Iceland. It has been heated by geothermal energy since the end of the seventies. Hot water is pumped to Akureyri from four different geothermal fields, Eyjafjordur
12-14 km south of the town, Glereardalur 2 km west of the town, Thelamork 10 km north of the town and, since the beginning of 2004, Hjalteyri 19 km north of the town. In addition to this two heat pumps have supplied about 3% of the annual energy production since 1984. They use return water from the district heating system, partly as a heat source and partly as a new supply water. The original heat pumps were replaced by two new heat pumps in 1998. They are 1.9 MWt each and designed for a COP-factor of 4.75. They use ammonia as refrigerant. Return water from part of the heating system is re-injected at 12°C to the Eyjafjordur field to sustain reservoir pressure and mine heat from the surrounding formations. The total installed capacity of the district heating system is 87 MWt and the annual hot water consumption is about 5 million m3.
After many years with insufficient supply of hot water from the geothermal fields a new high potential field at Hjalteyri was found. A well drilled in 2002 gave very good results and it is estimated that by the new field the water production can be doubled. This will secure hot water supply for district heating in the area for many years to come. The transmission pipeline built in 2003 from Hjalteyri to Akureyri is 19 km long, 300 mm in diameter and has a capacity of 120 l/s. Because of the abundant geothermal water district heating is now under development in the rural areas surrounding Akureyri.
The energy company Norðurorka was established 1 August 2000 with the merger of Akureyri Electricity Utility and the Akureyri Heating and Water Utilities. On 1 January 2003 it was converted to the limited company Norðurorka owned by Akureyri municipality. The company is responsible for energy supply in Akureyri and the surrounding area.",5. SWIMMING POOLS,"Until early in the last century, the use of geothermal energy in Iceland was limited to bathing, washing of clothing and cooking. These uses are today still significant and heating of swimming pools is among the most important types of uses after space heating. There are about 160 swimming pools in operation, 130 of which use geothermal heat. Based on their surface area, 89% of the pools are heated by geothermal sources, 7% by electricity, and 4% by burning oil.
Of the geothermally heated pools about 100 are public swimming pools and about 30 pools in schools and other institutions. The combined surface area of them is about 28,000 m2. Most of the public pools are open-air pools in use throughout the year. The pools both serve for recreational use and for swimming instruction, which is compulsory in schools. Swimming is very popular in Iceland and swimming pool attendance has increased in recent years. In 2002 it was the equivalent of 15 visits by every Icelander. In the greater Reykjavik area alone there are ten public outdoor pools and three indoor ones. The largest of these is the Laugardalslaug, having a surface area of 1,500 m2 and five hot tubs in which the water temperature ranges from 35 to 42°C. Other health uses, such as the Blue Lagoon, the Health Facility in Hveragerdi comprising geothermal clay baths and water treatments, are also very popular. The latest development in this field is a bathing facility in Bjarnarflag using effluent geothermal water from well supplying Kísiliðjan with stem.
In the last five years, about six new geothermally heated public swimming pools have been built in Iceland. Most of them have replaced older and smaller pools. The annual water consumption varies a lot from one pool to another,
but typically about 220 m3 of water or 40,000 MJ of energy is needed annually for heating one m2 pool surface area. This means that a new, middle-sized swimming pool uses as much hot water as is needed to heat 80-100 single-family dwellings. The total annual water consumption in geothermally heated swimming pools in Iceland is estimated to be 6,500,000 m3 which corresponds to an energy use of 1,200 TJ per year.",6. SNOW MELTING,"Geothermal energy has been utilized to a limited extent for heating pavements and melting snow in wintertime, with this usage increasing during the last two decades. Spent water from the houses, at about 35°C, is commonly used for deicing of sidewalks and parking spaces. Most systems have the possibility to mix the spent water with hot water (80°C) in periods when the load is high. In downtown Reykjavík a snow-melting system has been installed in the sidewalks and streets, covering an area of 40,000 m2. This system is designed for a heat output of 180 W per m2 surface area.
The total area of snow melting systems installed in Iceland is around 740,000 m2, of which about 550,000 m2 are in Reykjavik. The annual energy consumption is strongly dependent on the weather conditions, but in the average it is estimated to be 430 kWh/m2. The total geothermal energy used for snow melting is estimated to be 1,150 TJ per year. Over half of this energy comes from used, return water from space heating systems.","Electricity generation using geothermal energy has increased significantly in recent years. Figure 4 shows the development in the period 1970-2003. The installed capacity of geothermal generating plants now totals some 200 MWe. The total production in 2003 was 1,406 GWh
which is 16,6% of the total electricity production in the country.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The development in direct use of geothermal energy has been rather slow in Iceland for a number of years. Geothermal space heating is slowly increasing and according to a new energy forecast it is expected that in the long run the share of geothermal in space heating will increase from the present 87% to 92%. In spite of high potential it has not succeeded to find new industrial users that use geothermal energy on a large scale.
The main geothermal activity in Iceland during the last few years has been in high temperature geothermal exploration and drilling. This is expected to contionu for some time. The power plants that are planned or under construction will approximately double the existing 200 MWe installed capacity of geothermal power plants in the country.
The Geothermal Training Programme of the United Nations University (UNU) has operated in Iceland since 1979 with six months annual courses for professionals from developing countries. Specialized training is offered in different geothermal disciplines. The aim of the programme is to assist developing countries with significant geothermal potential to build up groups of specialists that cover most aspects of geothermal exploration and development. Most of the candidates receive scholarships financed by the Government of Iceland and the UNU. A MSc. programme
was started in 2000 in cooperation with the University of Oceland. From the beginning a total number of 300 scientists and engineers from 39 countries have completed the six month courses.",11. DISCUSSION,"As a result of a rapid expansion in the energy intensive industry in Iceland the demand for electricity has increased considerably. This has partly been met by increased geothermally produced electricity and two new project are now being carried out.
Reykjavik Energy is constructing a geothermal power plant at Hellisheiði in the southern part of the Hengill area. In the first stage the installed power will be 80 MWe and production startup is sheduled for 1st october 2006. Further expansion of the plant is expected later as well as hot water production for district heating in Reykjavík. At the end of 2004 10 wells had been drilled to supply steam te the Hellisheiði plant and 8 more are planned in the next few years.
Hitaveita Suðurnesja has been undertaken exploration and utilization on a small scale in the Reykjanes geothermal field for many years. In 2003 it was decided to build a new power plant on Reykjanes. Two turbines will be installed in the first stage, 50 MWe each. The plant will start production in 2006. A further expansion to 150 MWe is foreseen in the future. In connection with the plant 7 new wells have been drilled on Reykjanes during the last 5 years and 5 more are planned.
To meet the increing demand for high temperature geothethermal wells the drilling company Jarðboranir invested in a new drilling rig that started opereation in the summer 2004. The new rig, that is called Geysir, can drill up to 4,000 deep wells. It is the biggest and most advanced drilling rig in operation in Iceland.",10.6 New developments,"At Húsavík, in Northeast Iceland, electricity generation using geothermal energy began around mid-year 2000, when a Kalina binary-fluid 2 MWe generator was taken into service, among the first in the world of its kind. It utilizes hot water cooling from 120°C down to 80°C and satisfies about three-quarters of the electricity needs of the town of Húsavík. Part of the hot water leaving the generating plant is used by the district heating system for public heating.",10.5 Húsavík,"At Nesjavellir high temperature field Reykjavik District Heating (now Reykjavik Energy) has been operating a cogeneration power plant since 1990. The primary purpose of the plant is to provide hot water for the Reykjavik area 27 km away. Freshwater is heated by geothermal steam and water in heat exchangers. In October 1998 the power plant started electricity generation when a 30 MWe steam turbine was put into operation and a second one of the same size a month later. The working pressure of the turbines is 12 bar (190°C). Five additional wells will be put online, increasing the total hot water production to 200 MWt with the water production (82°C) reaching more than 1,100 l/s. In the condenser the steam is used to preheat cold water from 4°C to 60-70°C. This increased the efficiency of the plant significantly. In 2001 the plant was enlarged to a capacity of 90 MWe with the installation of a third turbine. Further expansion to 120 MWe is under construction and will be completed in 2005.
The total electricity generation of the Nesjavellir power plant in 2003 was 615 GWh.",10.3 Nesjavellir,"The Svartsengi co-generation power plant has been producing both hot water and electricity since it started operation in 1977. It is located on the Reykjanes peninsula, about 40 km from Reykjavik, and serves about 15,000 people. The geothermal reservoir fluid is a brine at 240°C and with a salinity of about two thirds of sea water. The geothermal heat is transferred to freshwater in several heat exchangers. The last few years several improvements and expansions have been done in Svartsengi power plant.
The oldest part of the plant has been totally reconstructed. The main emphasis has been put on increased electricity generation by installing a new 30 MWe unit, thus improving the overall efficiency of the plant considearably. Also the hot water production was increased by some 75 MWt. In connection with this four new wells were drilled in the Svartsengi geothermal field, of that one for reinjection.
After the completion of the expansion in late 1999 the total installed capacity of the Svartsengi power plant is 200 MWt for hot water production and and 45 MWe for electricity generation. Of that 8.4 MWe come from Ormat binary units using low-pressure waste steam. The total electricity generation of the Svartsengi power plant in 2003 was 368 GWh.
The effluent brine from Svartsengi is disposed of into a surface pond called the Blue Lagoon. It has for a long time been used by people suffering from psoriasis and other forms of eczema, who seek therapeutic effects from the silica rich brine. Also it is getting increasing popularity by tourists with an annual number of visitors about 170,000, making it one of Iceland’s most popular tourist attractions. In July 1999 the Blue Lagoon opened new facilities at a location 800 m from the previous site. They include indoor and outdoor bathing facilities, steam caves, mud pool and restaurants. The new facilities have gained much attraction and are expected to contribute to further increase in the annual number of visitors.
Sudurnes Regional Heating, the owner of the Svartsengi power plant, is operating a 0.5 MWe back-pressure turbine at the salt plant on the Reykjanes peninsula. The electricity generation of the plant in 2003 was 1.5 GWh.",10.4 Svartsengi,"The Krafla power plant in N-Iceland has been in operation since 1977. Two 30 MWe double flash condensing turbine units were purchased in the beginning, but because of inadequate steam supply the plant was run with only one of them installed for 20 years. The shortfall of steam was in part due to volcanic activity in the area which caused contamination of the geothermal fluids by the volcanic gases. This again caused operational problems in some of the production wells, mostly in the form of rapid scaling of complex iron silicates and also corrosion in the wells. Exploration drilling in the area has shown that the concentration of magmatic gases in the steam has decreased drastically.
The plant operated successfully with one unit installed for 20 years in spite of nine volcanic eruptions, the last one in September 1984. Initially the power generation was 8 MWe, but reached 30 MWe in 1982. The capacity of the Krafla power plant was expanded in 1997 from 30 to 60 MWe, and preparations are underway to increase the plant’s output by an additional 40 MWe in the next stage. There are also plans for building a new plant in the Krafla area.
Several production zones have been identified within the geothermal system in Krafla with large variation in temperature ranging from 210 to 350°C. Steam is separated from the water in two stages, at 7.7 and 2.2 bar absolute, to provide 120 kg/s high pressure steam and 30 kg/s of low pressure steam. The total electricity generation of the Krafla power plant in 2003 was 401 GWh.",10.2 Krafla,"The oldest geothermal power plant in Iceland is in Bjarnarflag (Namafjall field) where a 3 MWe back pressure unit started operation in 1969. This field also supplied steam to the Kisilidjan diatomite plant while it was in operation. The power plant has been operated successfully ever since the beginning 30 years ago except for three years in 1985-1987 when the plant was closed, partly due to volcanic activity in the area. The reservoir temperature is about 280°C. Steam is separated from the water at 9.5 bar absolute to provide a steam flow rate of 12.5 kg/s to a single flash turbine. The total electricity generation of the Bjarnarflag power plant in 2003 was 12 GWh.",10.1. Bjarnarflag,10. GEOTHERMAL ELECTRIC POWER GENERATION,"In the middle of the 1980s, an explosive growth in fish farming took place in Iceland and for a period there were over 100 fish farms in operation, many of them quite small. The industry encountered early problems and almost collapsed. Since 1992 the production has been slowly increasing to totally 4,000 tonnes in 2002 in about 50 plants. Salmon is the main species with about 70% of the production but arctic char and trout are also raised.
In the beginning fish farming in Iceland was mainly in shore-based plants. Geothermal water, commonly 20-50°C, is used to heat fresh water in heat exchangers, typically from 5 to 12°C. It requires large consumption of both freshwater and seawater and this adds considerably to the operating cost. However, this is still common, especially in raising trout. The electricity consumption is reduced by injecting pure oxygen into the water and thus cutting down on the waterchanges. Farming fish in cages floating along the shore is getting more common and has proved to be more economical than shore based plants in raising salmon. After many years with ocean ranching of salmon this production method was not found to be profitable and has now been given up.
The total geothermal energy used in the fish farming sector in Iceland is estimated to be 1,680 TJ per year. Of that about 65% is used for raising trout. It is expected that the production in fish farmimg in Iceland will grow at an increase rate in the future. This will mean increased geothermal utilization, especially in smolt production (trout and salmon).",9. FISH FARMING,"Apart from space heating, one of the oldest and most important usages of geothermal energy in Iceland is for greenhouse heating. Naturally warm soil had been used for a long time for growing of potatoes and other vegetables when geothermal heating of greenhouses started in Iceland in 1924. The majority of the greenhouses are in the southern part of Iceland. Most greenhouses are glass covered, but plastic film does not stand up well in the windy climate. The heating installations are by unfinned steel pipes hung on the walls and over the plants. Undertable or floor heating is also common. It is common to use inert growing media (volcanic scoria, rhyolite) on concrete floors with individual plant watering. The increasing use of electric lighting in recent years has lengthened the growing season and improved greenhouse utilization. This development has been encouraged by state
subsidies on electricity for lighting. CO2 enrichment in greenhouses is common, mainly by using CO2 produced in the geothermal plant at Haedarendi.
The greenhouse production is divided between different types of vegetables (tomatoes, cucumbers, paprika etc.) and flowers for the domestic market (roses and other flowers, potted plants etc.). Of this area 55% is used for growing vegetables and 45% for flowers. The total area under glass increased by 1,9% per year in the period 1990 to 2000 and was about 195,000 m2 in 2002. In the coming years it is expected that the total surface area of greenhouses will decrease in spite of increasing total production. This is because the competition with imported products and increased use of artificial lighting is expected to result in increased productivity in the greenhouse sector.
At several locations outdoor growing is enhanced by soil heating using geothermal water, especially during early spring. Soil heating has the main benefit of early thawing of the soil and the vegetables can be brought to market sooner. It is estimated that about 105,000 m2 of fields are heated this way. Soil heating is not an increasing application, partly because similar results are commonly obtained at a lower cost by covering the plants by plastic sheets.
The total geothermal energy used in the greenhouse sector in Iceland is estimated to be 940 TJ per year.",8. GREENHOUSES,"The diatomite plant at Lake Myvatn, near the Námafjall high temperature geothermal field, uses more direct geothermal energy than any other industrial enterprise in Iceland. The plant, which employs about 50 people and has been operational since 1967, produces some 28,000 tonnes of diatomite filter aids for export annually. It is one of the world’s largest industrial users of geothermal steam. The raw material is diatomaceous earth found on the bottom of Lake Myvatn. The geothermal steam is mainly used for drying, but also for other purposes such as pre-heating of fuel oil and diatomite slurry, space heating, deicing of holding pond and loading area and for dust elimination. Each year the plant uses some 230,000 tonnes of geothermal steam under 10 bar pressure (180°C), primarily for drying. This corresponds to an energy use of 444 TJ per year. For several technical and marketing reasons the plant will be closed down at the end of 2004. The owners of the plant plan to convert it to producing synthetic silica from imported quartz. If problems with financing the project will be solved and these plans realized the utilization of geothermal steam in the plant will probably increase by a factor of 2-3.
The seaweed product manufacturer Thorverk, at Reykhólar in West Iceland, also uses geothermal heat directly in its production. They harvest seaweed found in the waters of Breidafjordur in NW-Iceland using specially designed harvester crafts. Once landed the weed is chopped and dried on a band dryer that uses large quantities of clean dry air, heated to 85°C by hot geotherml water in heat exchangers. The plant has been operated since 1976 and produces 2,000-4,000 tonnes of rockweed and kelp meal annually, using 34 l/sec of 107°C hot water for drying. The product has been certified organic. The annual use of geothermal energy in the plant is about 150 TJ.
A salt production plant was operated on the Reykjanes peninsula for a number of years. From geothermal brine and seawater the plant produced salt for the domestic fishing industry as well as low-sodium health salt for export. During the last years the operation of the plant has been intermittent. Another example of industrial application that has faced financial fifficulties is drying of imported hardwood in Húsavík by geothermal water. After few yars of operation the plant was closed down in 2002.
Since 1986, a facility at Haedarendi in Grímsnes, South Iceland, has produced commercially liquid carbon dioxide (CO2) from geothermal fluid. The geothermal field has an intermedium temperature (160°C) and very high gas content (1.4% by weight). The gas discharged by the well is nearly pure carbon dioxide with hydrogen sulfide concentration of only about 300 ppm. Upon flashing, the fluid from the Haedarendi well produces large amounts of calcium carbonate scaling. Scaling in the well is avoided by a 250 long downhole heat exchanger, made of two coaxial steel pipes. Cold water is pumped down through the inner pipe and back up on the outside. By this the geothermal fluid is cooled down and the solubility of calcium carbonate raised sufficiently to prevent scaling. The plant uses approximately 6 l/sec of fluid and produces some 2,000 tonnes annually. The production is used in greenhouses, for manufacturing carbonated beverages and in other food industries.
Geothermal energy has been used for fish drying in Iceland for about 25 years. The main application has been indoor drying of salted fish, codheads, small fish, stockfish and other products. Yarlier cod heads were traditionally dried by hanging them on outdoor stock racks. Because of the wether conditions indoor drying is much to prefer. Hot air is blown over the fish and the moisture from the raw material removed. Today about 20 small companies are drying cod heads indoors and 17 of them use geothermal hot water and 1 geothermal steam. The annual export of dried codheads is about 15,000 tonnes, mainly to Nigeria, where thay are used for human consumption. In 2001 about 2 million tonnes of geothermal hot water were used for fish drying which corresponds to about 550 TJ. In addition to this drying petfood is a new and growing industry in Iceland with an annual production of about 500 tonnes.
Examples of additional industriel uses of geothermal energy on a small scale are retreading of car tires and wool washing in Hveragerdi, curing of cement blocks at Myvatn and steam baking of bread at several locations. The total geothermal energy used as process heat in industry in Iceland is estimated to be 1,600 TJ per year.",7. INDUSTRIAL USES,,Geothermal Development in Iceland 19951999,,A.

Over half of the primary energy supply in the country comes from geothermal energy. The main use of geothermal energy is for space heating and about 87% of all houses are heated by this energy source. Other sectors of direct use are swimming pools, snow melting, industry, greenhouses and fish farming. An expansion in the energy intensive industry has led to rapid increase in electricity demand in the country. This has stimulated the development of geothermal power production and resulted in new plants under construction. Two of the largest energy companies in Iceland, Reykjavik Energy and Hitaveita Suðurnesja, both have a new power plant for electricity production under construction. The total capacity of these two plants plus an expansion being made at Nesjavellir power plant is approximately 200 MWe.

According to both 1 dimensional and 3 dimensional interpretations of the new magnetotelluric (MT) data, the IDDP-2 site is located above a major heat source occurring at some 10 km depth.
The IDDP was initiated in the year 2000 by a consortium of three Icelandic energy companies, Hitaveita Suðurnesja (now HS Orka hf) (HS), Landsvirkjun (LV) and Orkuveita Reykjavíkur (OR), as well as Orkustofnun (OS), the National Energy Authority of Iceland. The same year the basis for the IDDP concept of drilling for supercritical water (374o C and 222 bars for pure water) was further explained at the World Geothermal Congress (WGC) 2000 in Japan (Friðleifsson and Albertsson, 2000). Supercritical
water has much higher enthalpy and lower viscosity than a two phase mixture of steam and water at subcritical temperatures and pressures (Dunn and Hardee, 1981; Hashida, et al. 2001; Fournier 1999). Our modeling indicates that a well producing supercritical water could have an order of magnitude higher power output than that from a conventional high-temperature geothermal well (Friðleifsson et al., 2003; Friðleifsson and Elders, 2005). However to reach supercritical conditions requires deep drilling, even in areas of high heat flow.
In 2007, Alcoa Inc. (Alcoa) (an international aluminum company) joined the consortium followed by Statoil (an international oil and gas company) in 2008. In 2007 the three Icelandic power companies announced their commitment to drill at their own cost a 3.5-4.0 km deep well in each of three geothermal fields operated by them. These wells were to be designed so that they would be suitable for deepening to 4.5-5.0 km. The deepening of one of these wells as a joint IDDP project would then be funded by the consortium, with additional funds from international science agencies. The first well in the series, IDDP-1, was drilled in 2008- 2009 at Krafla in North-East Iceland. The next wells, IDDP-2 and IDDP-3, were planned to be at Hengill and Reykjanes, respectively (Figure 1). These drilling plans, however, were jeopardized later that year due to the economic crisis in Iceland. Landsvirkjun (LV), however, kept to its commitment to drill the IDDP-1 well at Krafla in 2008 and 2009.
From the outset, the IDDP consortium welcomed the inclusion of basic scientific studies in the IDDP (Friðleifsson and Albertsson, 2000; Elders et al., 2001; Friðleifsson and Elders, 2005). The guiding principle was that the incremental costs of drilling and sampling for the science program, and their subsequent study, should be met by the scientific community.
In 2005, a well of opportuntity for IDDP for deepening, RN17 at Reykjanes, was lost during a flow test. In June 2006, after considering all options available, it was decided to move the IDDP operations to Krafla (Figure 1). The plan was to rotary drill the IDDP-1 down to 3.5 km depth and cement in the steel casings funded by Landsvirkjun (LV). Then the IDDP consortium would fund deepening the well IDDP-1 to 4.5 km into the supercritical zone, and take a number of spot cores for scientific purposes. However, as discussed below, IDDP-1 well could only be drilled down to 2.1 km depth where it intersected 900°C hot magma, which resulted in terminating the drilling operation (Friðleifsson et al., 2010; Elders and Friðleifsson, 2010)
The IDDP-1 Well at Krafla, NE-Iceland
The IDDP-1 well in Krafla was completed by Landsvirkjun (LV), the National Power Co., to 2.1 km depth in 2009. The drilling operation and the first results from that well have been described (Friðleifsson et al., 2010; Elders et al., 2010; and Elders et al., 2011). The general well design (Þórhallsson et al., 2010) had to be modified during drilling of the IDDP-1 well because of extensive problems during drilling of that well (Hólmgeirsson et al., 2010). In essence this involved inserting and cementing of the 13 5/8 inch anchor casing at 1949 m depth instead of the scheduled 2400 m depth. In retrospect it became apparent that these drilling problems were due to the proximity of a magmatic intrusion and drilling was terminated when molten magma flowed
into the well at 2104 m depth. The well was completed with a 9 5/8 inch cemented sacrificial casing to 1960 m depth, followed by a perforated 9 5/8 inch liner down to the bottom fill (19 m), which was composed of quenched volcanic glass above the magma at 2104 m.
Spot coring in the IDDP-1 well, using NSF funds, was attempted but failed due to lack of well stability. However, earlier in 2008 an extremely successful spot coring test (funded by ICDP and NSF), had been undertaken in well RN-17B at Reykjanes. The core barrel was designed by the IDDP technical team and specially built for IDDP (Skinner et al., 2010 a, b,), mostly funded by the ICDP award to the IDDP program.
In August 2009, after the well had been cooled by injection of copious amounts of cold water at 30-40 L/s during and after drilling, the IDDP-1 was allowed to heat. By January 2010 projections from repeated measurements of the rate of heating indicated that, by October 2010, undisturbed conductive heat transfer should increase temperatures to ~ 500°C at the bottom of the casing. In March 2010 a staged series of flow tests began, planned to continue for some months. By August 2010 the well was still heating under flowing condition and was producing dry superheated steam at 380°C at 18-19 bars wellhead P, and at a flow rate of 25 to 30 kg/s, potentially corresponding to some 25 MWe production capacity. The future of the well is still being evaluated and a series of tests will be performed during the 2011 flow tests and pilot production studies, briefly discussed below.
Well IDDP-1 has now been shut in since August 24, 2010. The flowline needed to be re-designed in an attempt to decrease flow velocity and thereby minimize erosion of the piping. Some minor modifications were also needed on the wellhead and flowline to prepare for the planned tests which include: (i) wet scrubbing of the steam; (ii) dry scrubbing of the steam; (iii) heat exchanger experiments; (iv) acid corrosion and particle erosion tests; (v) chemical monitoring; and (vi) reservoir response monitoring. The flow test will begin in early May 2011 and some results should be available for briefing at the GRC meeting in October 2011.
The IDDP-2 at Reykjanes in SW Iceland
The HS ORKA HF energy company (HS), is the operator of the Reykjanes field, and is currently generating 100 MWe power by two high-pressure steam turbines, each rated at 50 MWe. Expansion plans involve adding a third 50 MWe steam turbine and an additional 30 MWe low pressure 2nd flash brine plant. This will require several new deep and shallow steam wells within the next 2-3 years, as well as deep re-injection wells. One of the planned deep production wells could become the IDDP-2 well. After testing, the IDDP-2 would, eventually, be used as a make-up well (or a reserve well), if for some reason the deep drilling experiment does not lead to economic production. Meanwhile, HS is considering finding funds for drilling the IDDP-2, a fully cased well of 3.5 km depth. This well would be available for the IDDP consortium for deepening to 4-5 km depth by using 8 ½“ tricone bits and completed by inserting a 7“ perforated liner, if feasible. Spot coring for scientific studies will be attempted below 2.5 km depth, to the extent that scientific funds allow at that time.
The chief motivation for HS Orka to undertake such a challenging drilling operation is to address several basic questions:
1. Where is, and what is the nature of the base of the convecting Reykjanes hydrothermal reservoir? Is it heated by superheated steam from below?
2. Can the deep heat sources be exploited by injecting fluid into the hot rocks beneath the most productive part of the well field?
3. Will productive permeability be found at these great depths within the approximate center of the fault-related up-flow zone?
4. Does a supercritical reservoir exist at 4-5 km depth under Reykjanes or does it lie deeper still?
5. What is the nature of the ultimate heat source of this saline ocean floor related hydrothermal system; is it a sheeted dyke complex or a major gabbroic intrusion?
Temperature logs after drilling should throw some light on these issues. In the event production of supercritical fluid is not be achieved by the IDDP-2 well, the well could be converted either into a conventional production or an injection well, either by side-tracking out of the casings at conventional depths, or using unconventional depths for deep injection. With either end result, this experiment should result in a make-up or reserve well, with a high potential for success, justifying the high R&D investment cost.
The principal goal of HS as a partner in IDDP is to improve the overall geothermal economics by drilling extremely productive wells. The recent experience from IDDP-1 in Krafla should be viewed in this regard. IDDP-1 appears to be capable of producing 25 MWe even though supercritical conditions were not met. IDDP-1 yields superheated steam just above a hot magma intrusion, and it is quite possible that the bottom of the conventional convection cell at Reykjanes is fed by superheated steam cells established within a very hot sheeted dyke complex, though not necessarily at magmatic temperatures.
The challenge of 4-5 km deep drilling in the Reykjanes field is an important part of the HS Orka exploration strategy for the saline Reykjanes system, and will also provide valuable information for the international scientific community at large (Elders and Friðleifsson, 2009). This saline geothermal system is characterized by ocean floor geology from near surface downwards, and should closely resemble the mid-ocean ridges black smoker hydrothermal systems. The highest recorded temperature at the ocean floor black smoker is 464°C, reported from a black smoker at 5°S in the Atlantic Ocean (Koschinsky et al., 2008). Studying an analog of a black smoker system on land at Reykjanes, through a deep drillhole, will be an unprecedented opportunity that the geothermal industry and the scientific community at large should not miss. We invite them to join forces with IDDP to participate in the funding of the drilling and testing operation, as well as by detailed postdrilling studies
The IDDP-2 site location is essentially the same as that selected as the 1st priority site for the IDDP well at Reykjanes (Friðleifsson et al., 2003). Some 16 drillholes have been added since 2003 (wells 14 to well 30), geological and production data has accumulated, and recent geophysical data has been added, especially new
MT-data. A report, with 1D MT-interpretation was presented and delivered by ISOR last year (Karlsdóttir and Eysteinsson, 2010), and currently ISOR is about to complete a 3D interpretation of the same MT-data. A summary of these is described below based on current availability.
Most of the production wells drilled after 1999 are 2-2.5 km deep. Exceptions are wells RN-21, next well to proposed IDDP-2 site, and wells RN-27 and RN-28 which are directionally drilled shallow wells meant to tap a steam cap reservoir that has developed within the central portion of the geothermal field at ca 800-1100 m depth. The deepest wells are just over 3 km deep, RN-17 (3082 m – former IDDP well of opportunity for deepening); RN-17B a drillhole sidetracked out of RN-17 to 3077 m drilled depth, and RN-20B, 3009 m, an inclined well used for re-injection. The record temperature of the Reykjanes field is that from the bottom of RN-17B, 345°C. The well locations are shown on the geological map in Figure 2.",Lithology and Hydrothermal Alteration,"The Reykjanes field gives a unique insight into a submarine geothermal system. The geological succession depicts a steady buildup of volcanic strata within a submarine environment (e.g. Franzson et al., 2002, Franzson 2004, Friðleifsson and Richter, 2010). The deepest stratigraphic units, from 3 km depth up to some 1400 m are composed of pillow basalt formations, erupted in relatively deep waters. Then a few, but apparently subaerial lavas of Pleistocene age, occur in the stratigraphic sections in some of the wells up to ca 1100 m depth. From there up to ca. 400 m depth the eruptive units are characterized by relatively shallow water lithology composed of phreatic tuffs interbedded with shallow marine fossiliferrous sediments. From there and up to ca 60 m depth, sub-glacial and/or submarine hyaloclastite formations characterize the stratigraphic succession, while the youngest of these form low profile hyaloclastite ridges poking up through a Holocene lava flow series (Figure 2, overleaf). From the lithology, the subsidence rate was estimated to average some 0.6 cm/ year, while the extension rate of the slow spreading Reykjanes ridge is about 1.8 cm a year (Friðleifsson and Richter 2010). The intrusive rock intensity within the sheeted dike complex varies from well to well, but often the dikes appear in relatively dense dike swarms, 100-200 m thick, with thick intervening intervals of dike-free pillow basalt formations (e.g. Friðleifsson et al., 2005, Helgadóttir et al., 2008). The volcanic activity acts as a heat source for the geothermal system since considerable portions of the magma cools within the system as intrusions. Frequent, but generally small, earthquakes cause movements on the fractures and maintain good permeability.
The hydrothermal alteration pattern has been studied in all drillholes, and reported in numerous papers along with the lihologic logs and other data. Only some of these are included in the reference list below (e.g. Franzson et al., 2002, Franzson 2004, Friðleifsson at al., 2005, Helgadóttir et al., 2009). In addition, and in relation to the IDDP, quite a few more detailed mineralogical studies have added knowledge on the secondary mineralogy of the Reykjanes field (e.g. Freedman et al., 2008, Pope et al., 2009, Marks et al., 2010). The alteration pattern is characterized by zeolite and greenschist facies mineralogy. Epidote occurs at exceptionally shallow depth at Reykjanes, or
just below some 300 m depth in some cases, representing fossil Pleistocene thermal condition within the geothermal system, when an ice-sheet added to the hydrostatic pressure. The presentday saline hydrothermal system was at that time fed by meteoric fluids, as seen from isotopic- and fluid inclusion studies (Sveinbjörnsdóttir et al. 1986, Franzson et al. 2002, Pope et al., 2009). Smectite-zeolite facies mineralogy occurs from the surface down to the epidote zone in some cases. Epidote and mixed-layeredclays may coexist from there down 500 m depth or so, where chlorite-epidote zone takes over down to ca 1200 m, followed by epidote-actinolite zone down to 3 km depth, apparently (e.g. Friðleifsson et al., 2005). In the detailed study of Marks et al. (2010) on well RN-17, a new discovery of a high-temperature amphibole zone below 2400 m depth was reported that is transitional into amphibolite grade alteration. 87Sr/86Sr ratios within alteration minerals were observed to significantly shift towards seawater values with increasing depth, and therefore confirming deep penetration of seawater into the Reykjanes system (Marks et al., 2010). It is likely that amphibole facies mineralogy will characterize the IDDP-2 well at 4-5 km depth.
already developed at ~ 900-1100 m depth in the center of the geothermal field.
Below 900 m depth, the Reykjanes system is liquid dominated with temperatures rising along an adiabatic thermal gradient from some 270-290°C up to 320°C in a freely convecting hydrothermal system. This extends down to 2.5 km depth, at least (e.g. Figure 3), but with increasing depth the temperatures are expected to eventually rise towards magmatic temperatures. Exactly how, and at what depth, is simply not known at present, so modeling might be of help. Possibly the change from adiabatic gradient to a conductive thermal gradient rising towards magmatic temperatures, could occur over a relatively short depth interval, while the path of the temperature increase could be quite different. Incremental steps between convective and conductive heat paths could also be the case and other scenarios are quite possible. The highest temperature measured so far, 345°C, is from the bottom of well RN-17B, at about 2.8 km true vertical depth, and the temperature profile above still represents an adiabatic thermal gradient. The temperature distribution within the Reykjanes field is better viewed on an isothermal map at shallower depth, as show in Figure 4 for
depths of 20-30 km or more. In 2008, HS Orka hf, recruited ISOR to experiment with MTsurvey profiling at Reykjanes-EldvörpSvartsengi geothermal fields. The survey gave quite promising results along the test profiles (Rosenkjær and Karlsdóttir 2009). Following that a more detailed MT-survey was undertaken at Reykjanes in 2010, which immediately revealed quite interesting results, exemplified by Figures 5 and 6 (from Karlsdóttir and Eysteinsson, 2010).
The low resistivity image at 10 km depth under Reykjanes can be interpreted to represent a deep seated heat source of some sort, either a large cooling magma body (gabbroic)
1600 m depth. For comparison, also shown in Figure 4 are MT resistivity contours at 1600 m depth, rising from some 5 ohmm up to some 18 ohmm. The 13 ohmm contour forms a kind of a ridge between the >300°C thermal peak on the east side and the <260°C low on the west side. Possibly, close attention to 3D MT pattern could be used to deduce the likely thermal condition with increasing depth, while such a study is not available at present. The >300°C contours in Figure 4 form a peak around well RN-10 and a NE-SW ridge from the fumaroles field east of well RN-17 towards wells RN-12 and the other wells just east of the proposed site for the IDDP-2 well.",Geophysics,"Since the 1970s, surface resistivity surveys have been carried out in the Reykjanes field and surroundings. The earliest ones were direct current (DC) methods with Schlumberger configuration, but the later were TEM (transient electromagnetic), and then very recently MT (magnetotelluric) surveys. The early surveys delineated a low resistivity field centered on the furmarole field. The interpreted low resistivity field at 800 m depth has an areal extention close to 10 km2 (red line on Figure 2). The shape of the surfacing resistivity structure indicated a main upflow zone along the older NE-SW eruptive fissure zone intersected by shorter N-S trending upflow zone in the central part of the field (Karlsdóttir, 2005).
Until very recently, MT-surveys have not been applied in near shore environments in Iceland. The benefit of an MT survey is to image the upper crustal resistivity structures down to
Figure 3. Temperature profiles from well RN-12 and well RN-15. They are typical for the temperature distribution within the upper part of the geothermal system at Reykjanes, rising to some 270-290°C at 1 km depth and then only by some additional 10-20°C for the next 1,5 km.

The isotherms drawn are based on well temperature-logs and evaluation of the formation temperatures at 1600 m depth. The isotherms show a cooling “pond” at well RN-16 (~255°C) and a thermal peak at RN-10 (~310°C). The grayscale shades show MT-resistivity contours from <5 ohmm to ~18 ohmm.

or a dense sheeted dike complex. The low resistivity neck above it presumably indicates a heat plume, hotter than its surroundings and conveyed upwards to feed the conventional convecting hydrothermal system at Reykjanes. A report of the 3D MT interpretation is in preparation.
The site selection for the IDDP-2 drillhole is under review. The prime candidate is essentially the same as the 1st priority site suggested for the Reykjanes field in 2003. More recent drillhole data and new MT surveys have amplified the justification for selecting that site. Deep drilling to 4-5 km depth is an important part of the HS Orka hf exploration strategy for enhanced power production, either by direct use of high energy steam, or by attempting to enhance the field performance by re-injecting geothermal fluid deep into “super”hot rocks. HS Orka has plans to increase power production at Reykjanes from the current 100 MWe to 150 MWe by adding a 3d turbine and several new production wells. The realization of the IDDP-2 well at Reykjanes may well fit it into the drilling program for the expansion of the Reykjanes power plant.
The next phase of flow testing and pilot studies for energy production from the IDDP-1 well at Krafla will be concluded in 2011, including wet- and dry scrubbing of the steam, heat exchange experiments and other studies. The IDDP-1 well appears capable of some 25 MWe production from superheated steam heated by a shallow level magma body 20 m below the bottom of the well. The conclusion of these experiments is awaited with some excitement as it may lead to a new methodology of power production at Krafla. In the event that the IDDP-1 well turns out not to be sustainable for production, the option for creating the world hottest EGS system would still be open.",Acknowledgements,"We would like to acknowledge the IDDP energy consortium (HS Orka hf, Landsvirkjun, Reykjavik Energy, Orkustofnun, Alcoa and Statoil) for allowing us to continue to promote the

Modeling suggests that producing superheated steam from a supercritical reservoir could potentially increase power output of geothermal wells by an order of magnitude. To test this concept, the consortium planned to drill a deep well in each of three different geothermal fields in Iceland, namely, Krafla, and at the Hengill and Reykjanes fields in SW-Iceland. In 2009 the drilling of the first deep well, IDDP-1, was attempted in the active central volcano at Krafla in NE Iceland. However the drilling had to be terminated at 2.1 km depth when 900°C rhyolite magma was intersected. The well, IDDP-1, was highly productive, capable of producing some 25 MWe from 380°C superheated steam during a flow test undertaken in 2010. The well was shut in August 2010, to allow the wellhead and surface equipment to be modified to withstand corrosive fluids. Starting in May 2011 flow-testing, wet and dry scrubbing of the steam and a test of a heat exchange system will be conducted. This flow test is expected to last through the rest of 2011. Preliminary results from these tests should be available to report at the GRC Annual Meeting in October 2011. The second deep IDDP well, IDDP-2, could possibly be drilled to 4-5 km depth as early as 2012-2013, into the saline Reykjanes high-temperature field in SW-Iceland. The design of the IDDP-2 well will benefit from lessons learned during drilling of the IDDP-1 at Krafla. Here we review the geological and geophysical characteristics of the Reykjanes field, based on pre-existing and very recent data. According to both 1 dimensional and 3 dimensional interpretations of the new magnetotelluric (MT) data, the IDDP-2 site is located above a major heat source occurring at some 10 km depth. Introduction The IDDP was initiated in the year 2000 by a consortium of three Icelandic energy companies, Hitaveita Suðurnesja (now HS Orka hf) (HS), Landsvirkjun (LV) and Orkuveita Reykjavíkur (OR), as well as Orkustofnun (OS), the National Energy Authority of Iceland. The same year the basis for the IDDP concept of drilling for supercritical water (374o C and 222 bars for pure water) was further explained at the World Geothermal Congress (WGC) 2000 in Japan (Friðleifsson and Albertsson, 2000).

The seismic patterns and hydraulic properties corresponding to the three types of fractured reservoirs were characterized .That is, streaky fault type is clear fault pattern-permeable , small d e fracture network is seismic pattern of relatively continious-flat reflectors impermeable , and large scale fracture network is weakly-reflective seismic pattern strongly permeable. These results may contribute to a knowledge of fractured reservoir characterization. INTRODUCTION geothermal fields. As part of this program, we have carried out seismic reflection, VSP, crosswell seismic tomography, various loggings, and pressure transient tests in some geothermal fields where are the Tanna and the Kakkonda field (Honshu island), and the Yutsubo field (kyushu island). As a fractured reservoir forms various different structures caused by various tectonic and volcanic activities, it might be expected to obtain the different seismic and hydraulic responses corresponding to them. Especially, though we also felt uneasy that surface seismic methods in volcanic areas have often difficulty in imaging. the reflections due to strong attenuation and scattering in complex volcanic geology, we have been able to obtain records to image subsurface geological structure by the elaborated specifications of field surveys and data processing. In this paper, on the basis of seismic reflection and VSP data acquired in the above mentioned fields, we studied seismic response patterns on fractured reservoirs, the relationship between seismic response and hydraulic properties corresponding to some different fracture reservoirs were deduced. Geothermal reservoirs are usually found in fractured rock formations. For this reason, it is very important to evaluate geological and hydraulic characteristics of fractures in GEOLOGICAL SETTING geothermal exploration. Mapping the fracture distribution within the reservoir comprises a formidable task, since effective exploration techniques for fractured reservoirs do no exist in the early stages of field development. Since 1988, the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) and Japan Petroleum Exploration Co.,Ltd. (JAPEX) have been conducting a research program to evaluate the use of elaborated seismic exploration technology (e.g.,seismic reflection, VSP, tomography) for characterizing subsurface fractures in Geological setting of the three volcanic field are as follows 1) Tanna field The Tanna field is located in the northern part of the Izu peninsula, central Japan , and forms small basin (radius -1.Skm). Many volcanoes and hot springs exist around there. Especially, the active strike-slip fault the Tanna fault which is famous for a large earthquake fault among many seismologists is straight traced in the center of the basin. It is traced for more than 30km in N-S direction on the surface. The Tanna fault is a kind of a wrench fault.

In 1980 the re was a government po l icy to e s t a b l i s h a number of ""energy intensive"" i n d u s t r i e s including a second aluminium smelter.

In this the state of knowledge of the Ngawha Geothermal f i e l d was reviewed and it concluded that a geothermal power s t a t i o n could be b u i l t by incept ion. Information on the geothermal has been and this paper descr ibes the engineering and environmental s t u d i e s that were c a r r i e d o u t to prepare an Impact Report and obtain necessary f o r Government Approval of the project.

When the Ngawha power s t a t i o n was deferred i n late 1982, it nevertheless decided to complete work o r i g i n a l l y required for the EIR.

It is located in the north part of China. The geothermal exploration is started in 1970’s. Nine geothermal anomalous areas have been delineated. Since 1990’s, the use of hot water have been changed for space heating which is from basement reservoir at the depth 2000-4000m. As the ‘Geothermal resource appraiseate method’, ‘Geologic exploration standard of geothermal resource’ and ‘The Regulation of geothermal Resource Management in Tianjin’ have been carried out, geothermal development have been made into logal institutionalize.",Introduction,"Tianjin is situated in North part of China, at longitude 117°E, latitude 39°N. It has an area of 11305 km2, and most of it is plain.
Due to Tianjin’s location on the north China platform, the geothermal gradient is higher to 3.5-8.8oC/100m. It is covered with Quaternary and Tertiary system except mountain regions in Tianjin. The thickness is about 100-9000m. It is Ordovician, Cambrian and Precambrian formation under the Tertiary systems which are main basement geothermal reservoirs. Nine geothermal anomalous areas have been found and comprehensive researched. Two geothermal fields – Wanglanzhuang and Shanlingzhi have been explored.
During the development of Tianjin’s geothermal energy, governmental function has been playing an active role in guiding, promoting and regulating the scientific management of the energy.The development of the geothermal energy in Tianjin",Geothermal Exploration,"The stage of preliminary exploration, extraction is stimulated. In 1970s, the exploration in Tianjin had just started and was going on while exploration. Since the reserve was not found, the government gave the financial support to the exploration. Few enterprises and individuals invested in drilling hot wells because of the risk. The wells were drilled and placed in favorite sites by the exploration company and used by local people free of charge. The purpose of this was to make people know the new geothermal energy by using it to lay a foundation for future development. By the end of 1970s, The distribution, depth, type and total reserves of Tertiary geothermal resource have been established, and developed in large scale. It is covered with Cenozoic grope except mountain regions in Tianjin. The thickness is 100 – 400m in the north part of Baodi fault, 1000 – 2000m in uplift of south part of the fault and 8000 – 9000m in depression (figure.1). Immense amount of geothermal water in Tertiary reservoir is come from sandstone formation. The Area that Tertiary system covered is 9000km2. Nine geothermal anomalous areas have been delineated that take the geothermal gradient of 3.5oC/100m as the Geologic exploration standard of geothermal resource, which cover the areas 2320km2. Figure 1 shows main tectonic and nine geothermal anomalous areas. The highest geothermal gradient is 8.8oC/100m in the center of the anomalous areas.
Table 1 shows the basic data of geothermal anomalous areas.
The booming stage of geothermal development and utilization is in 1980s. The first basement geothermal well has been drilled in July 1979 that is pioneer of basement geothermal development in China. The exploration of Wanglanzhuang and Shanlingzhi geothermal fields were accomplished and the distribution and reservoir of geothermal energy was also identified to a certain
degree. The users got to know the advantages of the energy during the stage when preferential policy was implemented, so the demand to the energy was getting greater.
Table 2 shows the geothermal resource of Wanglanzhuang geothermal field
Table 3 shows the geothermal resource of Shanlingzhi geothermal field
It is widely used in industrial, textile, wood processing 73%, bathing 26% and agriculture 1%. Especially the economic benefit in industrial is remarkable (Figure 2 ).
Geothermal development made into a legal institutionalize
The stage of setting up special management agency and laying down regulation. In 1990s, the amount of geothermal wells is getting more and more as the scale of geothermal development is getting large. The purpose of geothermal development change from industry to heating and bathing as the living standard higher and higher. The temperature of the water is very important. The numbers of basement well increase every year. Hot water comes mostly from basement reservoir. The aquifer temperature is 70-100oC. The area of geothermal heating is 4500000m2. Production of hot water is 4870000m3, heating 83%, bath 15%, and fishing 2% (Figure 3 ). Many problems appear in the management of geothermal energy, such as the too rapid increasing of wells, the unreasonable placing of the wells, and the planless extraction. In 1994, Tianjin municipal government decided to set up Tianjin Geothermal Management Section on the basis of detailed investigation and demonstration and “The Regulation of Geothermal Resource Management in Tianjin” was issued in the same year. The regulation defined the main responsibilities of the geothermal management section which are as follows. (1) managing the exploration, development, utilization and conservation of geothermal resource, (2) making plans for geothermal development and utilization, (3) examining and approving the drilling of geothermal well, checking and ratifying extraction quota and issuing licence of geothermal extraction, (4) imposing geothermal resource fee, and (5) managing projects of
geothermal research and test. The 7th item of the regulation stipulates that licence is required for geothermal extraction. The procedure is : (1) making the application, (2) feasibility demonstration, and (3) examing and approving the application.
Geothermal energy is owed by the state, those who extracting geothermal water need to pay the geothermal resource fee to the state. The fee is charged according to the temperature of the water. The money is used mainly for the management, conservation, research and test of geothermal resource. Each well has to set the flowmeter to collect the data.
The stage of management according to the regulation and make comprehensive utilization. After legislative work, the management of geothermal development got onto the legal track. The governmental function played an important role in promoting the comprehensive use of geothermal energy. Comprehensive use is regarded as a prerequisite is the process of examining and approving the application of drilling geothermal wells, so that the users have to make full use of the energy and exploiting the water in a grading way, using the water for different purposes according to its temperature. The work of well rejection also started with the support of the government. At the beginning, the government gave money to carry out rejection test in geothermal reservoirs of different type.
Four injection experiments have been carried out in Tianjin. Table 4 shows the basic information of the four injection experiment The first injection experiment has been carried out during 1982 – 1986 in Tertiary reservoir of Wanglanzhuang geothermal field in Tianjin.
The injection experiment of Dagang district was carried out in Tertiary reservoir during 1987 – 1990 with two types: a), well 2 and well 5 are production wells where locate about 100-150m from injection wells R2 and R12. The injection water is from depth 700m 37oC and 1370m 55oC. b, The waste water from heating system are used in injection experiment. The production well R2 located about 1820m from injection well R12. Table 5 is the basic information of the injection experiment. The injection experiment of Tanggu was carried out during 1992- 1996. During the experiment hot water is from Tertiary system
reservoir for space heating, the wasted water from heating system was used for injection. The production well TR5 locates 650m from injection well TR91. Table 6 is the basic information of the injection experiment.
The experiment of Wanglanzhuang geothermal field is carried out during 1996-2000. During the experiment 70oC waste water from heating system is injected into the injection well, Which the depth is 1600m. At first the injection rate is 100m3/h with the lower water head pressure, and later the injection rate at 70- 80m3/h. Total amount of injection is 270129m3, last 5 month. Concurrently the water level in nearby wells is monitored carefully. Chemical tracers test are going to be employed during the winter 1998.
After experience had been gained, the policy of examining and approving applications was adjusted to facilitate rejection. For example, reinjection must be carried where conditions permit. The users who carry out reinjection enjoy a preferential treatment of reducing geothermal resource fee.",Conclusions,"It can be seen from the history of geothermal development in Tianjin, the role of the government cannot be substituted by others during the process of development. It is the basis for scientific management of geothermal resource. 1. In the initial stage, the reserve was not found, the government
gave the financial support to the exploration. its encouraging policy makes the people know the energy and its advantage.
2. In the second stage, it lets the user see the economic benefit
brought by geothermal energy, laying a wide foundation for further development. 3. In the stage of legislative work, it brings the management to
the legal track so that the level of management get raised.
4. In the stage of scientific management, it assures the
sustainable development of the geothermal development under the legal institution.",Acknowledgements,The author would like to thank for the staff of Geothermal research Institute working during the geothermal exploration and allowing publication of the data.

HOT WATER SPRINGS OF NORTHWESTERN IRAQ
F.D.S. Al Sawaf - Hydrogeologist
SUMMARY:
In the Lower Fars Formation, northwestern Iraq, the origin of the heat in the aquifers and springs has been studied in relation to water quality, subsurface environment, gas contents and biological activity within the aquifers.
The major constituents of the Lower Fars Formation (Middle Miocene) are evaporites, gypsum and anhydrite, limestone, marl and claystone. This formation provides the native sulphur deposit for Iraq.
Many water samples from springs and wells have been analysed for their mineral content as well as for sulphate reducing bacteria, Desulfovibio.desulfuricans. The temperature of these springs were also recorded for different periods of time together with the discharge rates. These data were correlated with the lithology of the stratigraphic units and with the temperature log of some wells.
The temperature of the groundwater in this formation is variable. In Mishraq sulphur structure is about 21°C in the overburden water and reaches up to 31°C in the deposit water. In Hamam Al-Ali main spring, Ain Zahra, it ranges between 47 and 50°C.
The chemical composition of the spring's hot water is correlated with the aquifer water of the surrounding areas. This shows that the hot water aquifers are limited under certain depths only. In such aquifers, the sulphate ion concentration has dropped to as little as 26 milligram per litre compared with the nearby water taken from a well in the same aquifer which has 1-50 milligram per litre. On the other hand, the bicarbonate CO 2 and HS concentrations are higher in the hot water and the pfi value is lower.
The population of bacteria is found to be maximum in aquifers containing ample supply of hydrocarbons, sulphate ions and continuous flow of ground water. It is therefore concluded that the sulphate reduction reaction in the presence of bacteria is responsible for the formation of H 2 S gas, the increase of the groundwater temperature, and the alteration of the chemical composition of the natural water in limited areas of this formation.

OBSERVATIONS ON THE GROUP OF THERMOMINERAL SOURCES IN THE AREA OF ELEFTHERON (EAST
MACEDONIA - GREECE)
By
• Elias Kleob. Baliktsis
SUMMARY
The group of thermomineral sources in the area of Eleftheron is found on the western banks of Marmara river and at a distance of 1.5 km from its ejection to the sea (Strimonikos or Orfanos Gulf). This area is 25 km away from the ejection of the Strymon river to the Homonymous Gulf (Central Macedonia).
The temperature in four of the main integral spouts fluctuates about 40°C.
The group of thermomineral sources lies southwest of the Pageo mountains and near the appearance of granite on the Simvolos mountain.
In this area two systems of faulting lines meet:
a) At the Marmara river in a north-south direction where this has created the valley of river flow.
b) At migdoma trench in a west-east direction where this is responsible for the creation of the basin of Lagada and Volvis lakes in north and northeast Halkidiki.
The area of Eleftheron belongs to the zone of complex sulphide of Eastern Halkidiki.
Generally the thermomineral sources of Eleftheron and these which are met westerly are connected with continuous movement of crumbled crust of the earth along the initial faulting lines.
The proof of these movements is the frequent strong tectonic earthquake in the area of Migdonia trench.

MACEDONIA - GREECE)
- 2 -
The appearance of thermomineral sources in this area as post-volcanic marks are connected with the hydrothermal deposits of Magnesite in South Halkidiki and the frequent veins of complex sulphide and other ores.
Last, it was found by X-ray analysis of water that there is Sr, Rb and Ba.
These elements are the result either of the granite washing (where it was found that there is Sr and Rb) or of the gypsum and barium deposits which meet northwards.

NEW DATA ABOUT SOME THERMOMINERAL SPRINGS
OF FRENCH ALPS.
by Bernard Bosch, Jean Dazy, Michel Lepiller, Phillippe Olive, Pierre Andre Poulain et Jean Sarrot-Reynauld.
The S 34 isotopic contents of sulphates and sulphides in Aix Les Bains (Savoie) springs waters (45 0C) (in french alps external zones) have been analysed.
These waters come from a mixture in which we make out
some cold sulphating waters (Marlioz type)(II0C) mineralized by a washing of oligocene evaporits of the "" Albanais"" basin some hot waters (70 o C), slightly mineralized, recognized by a boring (2.000 meters deep) in the Tithonic.
This mixture take place even with a large breaking. This fault crossing the subalpine ranges transversally is a satellite of the Semmoz crossfolding.
With the same manner, the S 34 isotopic contents of sulphates in the springs waters of Monetier les Bains, Plan de Phazy, Reotier (Hautes Alpes) in the ""brianconnaise zone"", have been analysed.
As for the majority of the surrounding cold springs, the mineralisation of the waters comes from the washing of the Trias evapotits.
But the thermalisation produces it even with some accidents of the stand crossing the big tectonic zones transversaly. Now these
1 accidents are the seat of a sismic working. ! The big accidents of the stand crossing
the main structural alpine directions transversaly play a very important part in the localization or the thermalisation of the waters. -
I So, it confirms the importance of the
E-W directions in the thermal and sismic workings around the mediterranean sea.

RADON CIRCULATION AND DISTRIBUTION IN THERMAL AND COLD SPRINGS- FROM CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN ITALY
by M. Brondi - M. Dall'Agl
Abstract
In the last years an increasing interest has been paid to the Radon geochemistry due to the multipurpose applications of the distribution of this radioactive gas in natural fluids; from earthquake prediction to environmental studies, to exploration for uranium.
Our present knowledge on the Radon geochemistry 'is,. nevertheless, scanty and incomplete.
Due to the above reasons a systematic study on Radon circulation in thermal and cold fluids has been undertaken with new and better understanding of the geochemical behaviour of this peculiar pathfinder element.
In particular Radon distribution has been studied in many cold and thermal springs from Latium, Sicily, Campania and Tuscany regions. The Radon content has been studied with respect to Uranium, Radium and major and minor constituents dissolved in the water samples examined.
It is not easy to summarize the results till now obtained. Briefly there are two main patterns of Radon circulation according to the possibility of migrating in the gas phase, which is highly mobile or in liquid phase; in this case the mobility of Radon is much lower.
A factor which plays an important role in determining the final Radon content we find in natural fluids is the intensity of the water-rock interaction and the possibility to migrate from the minerals in which Radon originates to the fluid phase.
In the paper all the above quoted problems are discussed in detail and an attempt is made to recognize the main, basic processes which regulate the Radon distribution and circulation in natural fluids.

Heat flow caused by water migration along faults in dependence on petrophysical parameters
Considerable heat can be transported by water, heated up at depth and migrating to near-surface strata, because of its large heat capacity. This can lead to anomalous geothermal gradients.
Vertical water migration can be caused by two mechanisms: 1. With burial and sinking of sedimentary
layers, their porosity decreases with increasing depth. Thereby water is expelled from the pore space and forced to migrate to the surface or toward fracture systems. The velocity of migration is mainly determined by the rate of sinking, with this process.
2. Local heat sources at depth can cause a temperature-induced lateral density gradient and thus hydrostatic pressure gradient in the communicating pore water. With sufficient permeability of the overburden, _a considerable convection can happen this way, and water from a relatively wide lateral range may move upward in a relatively narrow ""chimney"", after heating. With this process, the vertical permeability is the main quantity of influence.

GEOCHEMICAL STUDY OF THE GARGANO PROMONTORY THERMAL SPRINGS (APULIA REGION-SOUTHERN ITALY).
F.Carlin+-R.Gragnani++-G.F'aganin++ AB STfi ACT This work reports the results of the hydrogeochemical study carried out on the main springs and wells of the Gargano promontory and on the ground-waters of the Tavoliere of Foggia. In the same areas strong positive gravi metric, magnetic anomalies are known as well as high geothermal gradients and thermal waters. High seismicity and active faulting are other peculiar characters of the area. The spring waters Of Gargano are aresult of the mixture of waters coming from the leaching of carbonates with waters of marine origin. During their flow across the continent, the sea waters become enriched in Ca-, HCO3' SiO2' Li',Rb, Sr, B, etc. The geochemical properties observed in the Gargano area have made it possible to distinguish the springs of the Varano lake and Vie ste from those of Manfredonia-Siponto and S.Nazario (Lesina lake). This could depend upon the position of the springs in respect to the Tavolie re. It has been tested that the shallowest ground water of Tavoliere is separated from the Garga no ground water but from the geochemical point of view deep Tavoliere aquifer can mix with Gar gano ground water. The temperatures of the S. Nazario spring (27°C) and of a- well at Poggio Imperatore (36°C) are correlated with a relatively deep circulation. (+)-C.N.E.N.-Laboratorio di Geologia Ambien-

CALCUL DE L'ECOULEMENT SOUTERRAINE DANS LES AQUIFERES PAR LES MESURES DE LA TEMPERATURE DE L'EAU.
Par D. COnstantinidis Dr. Hydrogeologue
Les aquifares de la region de la Thessalie ont eta etudies au point de vue leur proprietas physiques et chimiques en raison de l'exploitation des eaux souterraines.
Ainsi par plusieurs points d'eau, nous avons pris des echantillons d'eau pour faire l'analyse chimique complet ou pour mesurer la temperature d'eau. Aussi de mesures de la transmissiviteont ete faite dans les forages pour faire la carte de la transmissivite.
L'existance des documents de mesure de la temperature sur cheque point d'eau et pendant une epoque connue A permis de tracer les courbes de la temperature des eaux souterraines (isothermes des eaux souterraines).
Une telle carte de la temperature des aquiferes peu profondes (de 15 A30 in de profondeur) A 'ate etablit dans . la region de la Thessalie orientale.
En comparant cette carte avec la carte des hydroisohypses et des lignes de l'ecoulements des eaux souterraines nous avons trouvg que les deux cartes ressemblent. Dans les regions ou les aquiferes sont homogenes, les courbes hydroisohypses sont pareilles avec les isotharmes des eaux souterraines, tandis que dans les regions ou les aquifares sont hetergenes y a une difference.
Pendant le printemps, la diminution de la temperature de l'eau poursuit les lignes de l'ecoulement des eaux souterraines et en aval de l'ecoulement l'eau prend la temperature du sol. Donc la direction de la diminution de la temperature de l'eau est la meme que la direction de l'ecoulement des eaux souterraine.
Nous puvons observer une autre propriete qui caractirise la temperature des aquifares: Dana les zones ou la transmissivite de l'aqui)reest grande a cause de la grande circulation d'eau et pendant les mois de printemps, nous avons une lent augmentation'de la temperature en aval des ecoulements souterraine, tandis que dans lea zones ou in transmissivite est petit, l'augmentation de la temperature en aval de l'ecoulement souterraine eat rapide.

HYDROGEOLOGICAL CONDITIONS OF THE THERMAL WATER IN THE AREA AROUND TRIPOLI, LIBYAN ARAB REPUBLIC
by
M.Sh. Diab l A.A. Al Missallati 2
Abstract
In the area around Tripoli, L.A.R. exists a number of thermal water points (50-65°C). The thermal water occurrences receives nowadays, more governmental interest from the point of view that thermal water is of significant importance from different aspects:
a. As a source for specific trace elements b. As a remedy for some diseases (especially
skin diseases and rheumatic pains).
The hydrogeological conditions of these water points were the matter of interest for the author. The formations containing the thermal water are these belonging to middle Miocene and lower cretaceous. These aquifers are artesian aquifers as a result of the geological conditions prevailing under the area occupying the north-western part of Libya in,,general.
The effect of tectonic framework and structural evolution have been considered in the present article as a factor responsible for the thermal phenomenon.
The hydrogeochemical aspects of the thermal water have been considered aiming into further clues for the geothermal conditions in the area. Attention has been paid to the radioactive elements as a source for geothermal energy in the groundwater.
Proposals for further studies (quantitative and qualitative) have been submitted arming into precise planning for beneficial utilization of these thermal water occurrences.

THE APPLICATION OF CHEMICAL HYDROGEOTHRRMOMETLRS TO GROUND-WATERS
IN ISRAEL
By
Yoram Eckstein Geological Survey of Israel, Jerusalem
ABSTRACT
The application of chemical hydro-geothermometers to groundwater sources requires an understanding of the hydrologic history of the fluid constituents. The water in many warm springs in Israel consists of mixtures of hot water that has ascended from depth and of fresh, cool water of shallow circulation. The origin of the hot water and the character of subsequent equilibration reactions between the fluid and solid phases are paramount factors in applicability of various chemical hydro-geothermometers. Na-K-Ca geothermometer is useless in the case of connate ancient sea or evaporative brines involved in dolomitization and ionic superfiltration. On the other hand, this geothermometer may be useful in cross-checking on postulated mixing schemes between hot connate waters of ancient recharge and cool waters of shallow circulation.

THE INTERRELATION BETWEEN HEAT FLOW AND GROUNDWATER CIRCULATION IN ISRAEL
by _
Yoram Eckstein Geological Survey of Israel, Jerusalem*
ABSTRACT
Terrestrial heat flow in Israel varies from 0.31 to over 11.11 cal/cm 2 sec. Distribution of the results shows extreme contrasts over remarkably small areas. Groundwater movement within the sedimentary stratum, enhanced by dense and complex fault system, plays major role in occurence of the surface heat flow pattern in Israel. This role may be classified into two basic hydrologic-thermal processes. A cooling effect of the contemporary recharge groundwater is evident on the Samarian and Judean Anticlines, in the Galilee fault-block structures and within the tectonically undisturbed young Rifief Valley fill. Circulation of warm to hot wate2s, facilitated by dense network of the deep faults associated with the Rift System is responsible for geothermal focci. The latter may-b associated with a genuine crustal geothermal anomaly, offering a potential target for geothermal development, or with a deep circulation of groundwater through ""non-geothermal"" subsurface, offering very limited - in terms of temperature - geothermal resource. Two conceptual models illustrating the system in the two configurations are presented.

Abstract
Diatoms of six (6) Greek thermal springs have been examined from the ecological point of view, and with special reference to the following environmental factors: Hydrogen Ion concentration (pH), organic pollution, temperature, water current and dissolved oxygen.
Most of the identified diatoms belong to the alkaliphile forms. The majority consist of exclusively fresh-water species or of freshwater species which sometimes can be found in brackish-water. The mesohalobien and oligohalobien species are both present in equal proportion.. Species . which prefer an abundant supply of oxygen were noted 7 in an increased frequency - in all the partial biotopes of the investigated thermal springs.
The b-mesosaprobic species are dominant, while the a-mesosaprobic come afterwards.
The diatom flora differs in the investigated thermal' springs. Most of the diatoms found are eurytherm. The upper thermotolerant point of diatoms_does not seem to be higher than 45 oC.

STUDY OF THE THERMAL WATERS OF NORTH-WEST TUSCANY
R.Fancelli°, M.Fanelli°, S.Nuti°.
On the basis of the data provided by chemical and isotopical analyses a study was made of the thermal waters in Tuscany north of the river Arno to define the hydrothermal system with which they are connected. Three main water families were recognized: sodium-chloride, calcium-sulphate and calciumbicarbonate.. Their chemical composition is de-
: pendent on the nature of the rocks crossed during circulation. - A reconstruction was made of the temperature
trend in the deep reservoir, using quantitative geothermometers based on Si02 and the Na-K-Ca ion ratios. The calculated temperatures were seen to increase progressively eastwards, that is, relative to a deeper circulation of the waters made possible by the regional-tectonics. The oxygen isotopic composition has led to a
definition of the average elevation of theahsorption areas of the meteoric waters feeding the various circuits.

ACQUI HYDROTHERMAL MANIFESTATIONS (PIEDMONT)GEOCHEMICAL STUDY.
R.FancelliO, S.NutiO, F.D'Amoreo.
Acqui thermal waters all derive from the same thermal water table and are characterized by a mainly sodium-chloride chemical composition. ttixing in various proportions with weakly mineralized surface waters gives rise to differences in temperature and total salinity. The quantitative geothermometers, based on
Si0 2 and the Na-K-Ca ion ratios give the same order of values for the temperature in the deep reservoir.
As the values obtained were in good agreement it is believed that the effective deep temperatures are in the order of 100. °C. Consequently, the temperature of these waters need not be justified, as in the past, by the presence of an anomalous heat flow caused by cooling magmatic bodies. It is believed, in fact, that these waters at-
tain their heat by circulating at 3000 m or more, as a result of the regional geological setting.

Paris 7.
Complete analysis of about 200 hot springs in
French Massif Central show some subsuperficial
changes in composition of the waters:
(1) mixing with fresh waters
(2) reequilibrations occuring at emergence temp-
erature
(3) dissolution of superficial minerals by the
CO 2-rich waters.
We present some detailed examples of these
processes:
a) equilibration with amorphous silica for
many springs,
b) equilibration with calcium carbonate Defore
degassing (Chateauneuf springs)
c) dissolution of minerals resulting in an in-
crease of amounts of dissolved Mg, Ca and K
(Vichy-St Yorre springs)
These changes in chemical composition prevent
the application of geothermometers (silica,Na/K,
Na.K.Ca). The study of superficial changes
allows us, in some cases, to derive the initial
concentrations, and thus temperature at depth.

HYDROLOGIC RESEARCH OF THE KORPI MONASTIRIOU SPA
by
I. Andreadis and C.N. Garagunis Athens/Greece
The tectonic structure, as well as the structures of layers and of petrifactions and the development of a Karst field in the area of the Korpi Spa are responsible for the creation of this spa. We can characterize this spa as an amounting, karstic, breach spring. The spring is supplied with the karstic water of the massives which are situated to its south and consist of corlonate sediments.
The area of gushing up of the spring, as found out during the borings which were made for supplying water to the town of Vonitsa, is intensely breached. We hold on to the opinion that the gushing up of the spa takes p lace along a breach which in greater depths intersects karstic waterconduits. Consequently the water carried in these conduits comes up to the surface by following the openings of the breach.
The enrichment of the karstic water in some ingredients and its characterization as mineral water can be explained as follows:The phenomenon of the plaster diapyrism (SLanupLouog) and the exit of plaster on the surface is common in the greater area of the springs. The passage of underground karstic water through plaster is therefore secured, as well as its passage through carbonate sediments of tertiary, jurasic and cretian ages. As a reTylt of this, the karstic water is enriched . in Ca , Me+, HCO and other ions during its passing through the higher layers of petr“actions.
The springs supply basin obviously stretches in the greater area, mainly in the Acarnanic Mountains. As surfaCe geology concludes, the extensively spread carbonate sediments can be theoretically considered as supply bacin of the Korpi spring, as well as the other springs of the area (Helona, Neraida etc.). These sediments are linted from every side by flysche and breaches leaving as only exit point the area of the Korpi spring and other springs,-

THERMAL SPRINGS OF NIGRITA
By
C.N. Garagunis and Ch. K. Dimitroulias Athens/Greece
The complex of thermometallic springs of Nigrita is situated in the Strymonic Volcanic Arc and has, characteristically, two rays of faults which cross each other in the neighbourhood of the springs.
The water temperature is between 50-52°C. Analysis,- by the most recent methods, has shown that the temperature of the geothermic field is quite high, the lowest limit being 130-1400C.
On the surface two kinds of springs are observed: thermometallic and drinkable mineral springs. It has been further observed that there is a rise in content of CO2 and Rn in the cold-water spring while the hot-water spring has a lower content.
. The -high content of CO 2 and Rn verifies the view pertaining to volcanic origin.
According to Anagnostidis, Cyanophycae Mastigocladus has been discovered, characteristic of the existence of juvenile waters.
In addition taking advantage of the spring value for solely touristic purposes, it is possible to make Use of the existing geothermal field for production of electricit: manufacturing, heating, greenhouses, etc.

THE RELATION OF STRONTIUM (Sr) OF HOT AND COLD WATERS AND ROCKINESS OF THE MALIC AREA (CENTRAL-EAST OF GREECE)
By
C.N. Garagunis E. Mposkos A.G. Vgenopoulos Athens/Greece
Qualitative analysis of trace elements made by X-rays-fluorescence of thermometallic springs, cool-springs, and the rocks bordering the Malic Gulf which are, as known, Triassic-Jurassic limestones with flint formation, Cretaceous limestone and reienst andesite.
For the possible co-relation of the mentioned element to the water of the rocks, quantitative analytical work has been made.
The results show that the Sr content of the water of the thermometallic springs (50-395 ppm) is higher than that of the cold spring waters (12-95 ppm) also Sr content of waters in the andesite is higher than the Sr content of waters contained in the other rocks.
The highest content of Sr was found in the'aragonite deposited round the hot spring.
The high content in Sr in the andesite in comparison to the other rocks occurring in the area and the comparative high contents of Sr in the hot water in comparison to the cold water suggests that the Sr of the hot water springs is derived from the andesites.

The Use of Tritium ( 3 H) and Carbon-14 ( 14C) in Determining the Age of Groundwaters
by
Dr. Nikolaus Georgotas, sci. assoc. at the Institute of Hydrogeology and Hydrochemistry Tech. Univ., Mfinchen. Director: Prof. Dr. K.-E. Quentin
Summary: The environmental isotopes tritium and carbon-14 are produced by the effects of neutrons, generated by cosmic rays, upon nitrogen atoms. After oxidizing to H 20 and CO2 in the atmosphere they reach the groundwater with the precepitation. Furthermore they also develop as artificial side-products of thermonuclear explosions and industrial processes and after reaching the groundwater induce a global labelling of the groundwater. As a result both radioisotopes are successfully used in solving many hydrological problems in ground-water research. Among the Many uses of tritium and C-14 in hydrology, agedetermination takes a special place. The theoretical basis of groundwater dating with •tritium and C-14 methods are explained here and many uncertainty factors which these methods have are explained and discussed. Subsequently there is a short explanation of the methpds used to determine the two radioisotopes in the laboratory.

springs located on both sides of the northern
part of the Suez Gulf are discussed.
Springs are distinguished into non-
thermal springs (7-20°C) mainly occurring in
Wadi El-Taiyba area, warm springs (20-33°C) in
Ayun Musa and El-Sockhna areas and very hot
springs (60-72°C) in Hammam Faraun area.
Thermal springs are located along dis-
tinct fault lines.Hydrogeological and-hydrogeo-
chemical evidences indicate that they are fed
by deep seated Miocene, Lower Cretaceous and
Jurassic aquifers containing ground-water under
high hydrostatic pressure.
Ground-water types, mainly, of meteoric
origin, were subjected to different processes
of metamorphism and mixing with recent and old
sea water and brines rich in bromine salts.
Some evidences suggest the partial contribution
of juvenile water in the formation of the ther-
mal ground-water in Hammam Faraun area which is

Abstract
A group of warm mineral springs having famous
therapuetic properties is the subject of the
present study. These springs are located at the
contact of the Miocene Limestone plateau and the
alluvial deposits of the Nile Valley in the area
extending from east of Cairo, Southward, till
Helwan town.
Hydrogeological observations and water chemi-
cal analysis were carried out periodically from
June, 1967 till October, 1968. Chemical data are
presented and graphically illustrated and ana-
lysed. Genesis of ground-water is discussed on
basis of hydrogeochemical data and hydrogeologi-
cal informations.
Ground-waters of the studied springs are ~n
variably of chloride sodium chemical type, some
times with abundant H 2 S. No appreciable variation in water chemical properties was observed, with
time, except with respect of water salinity in
some localities.
Hydrogeological and hydrogeochemical evidences
suggest deep seated origin of the studied spring
waters. Most probably, they are fed by the Lower
Cretaceous Nubian Sandstone aquifers. However, in
some localities, partial feeding of springs from
shallow aquifers is evident.

RECENT MARINE IRON RICH SEDIMENTS FROM SANTORINI, GREECE. H.W.Hubberten & H.Puchelt, University of Karlsruhe, Federal Republic of Germany. Recent marine iron rich sediments in some bays of the volcanic islands Neaand Palaea Kameni chiefly consists of siderite (framboids), pyrite (fra~~oids), iron sulfides, opal (diatoms), Fe hydroxide and organic material; small quantities of allophane are also found. The chemical composition of the air dried sediments varies as follows: Fe 70 3 ~ to 64\, SiO 10 to 64\, Na ° 3,7 to TO,S\, CaO 0,3 to 3,6\, MgO O,~ to 3,2\, CI 3,9 to 13\, S04 0,5 to 6\, CO 2 0,1 to 22\, S 0,1 to 19\. All trace elements in the sediments - except As - are depleted to the supposed parental material. The REE's are relatively less depleted. The ore forming solutions are formed due to reaction of acid hydrothermal solutions (CO or SO containing- today H S free) with volca~ic calc-alkaline rOEks. Today the CO 2 saturated and u~3to 41 C warm solutions precipitate Fe hydroxide in the water column close to the surface and in a narrow zone above the sediment. Iron oxidizing bacteria participate actively in the sediment formation. Various types of mostly benthic diatoms are also deposited along with this precipitation. Diagenetic alterations of the formed sediments results in bacterial sulfate reduction and in the formation of iron sulfide and iron carbonate. The conditions of formation of these iron sediments can be used as a general model for volcanic iron ore deposits of the ""Lahn - Dill"" type.

The Thermomineral springs of Methana by Dr. Elisseos K. Karageorgiou - Hydrogeologist
In the Peninsula of Methana are many thermomineral springs. Two groups of mineral springs are distinguished. In the first group belong the thermomineral springs of an alkali-sulphate composition rich in containing of hydrocarbonate acid. These springs are in three different places in the peninsula.
The first one is at the south end of the Methana town by the Vromolimni, with a temperature fluctuating between 30o -34oC. The water is contaminated with the sea water in a percentage of 75 -90%; the rest 10 - 25% of the water is a vadose water.
The catchment area is consisted partly by the Cretaceous limestone of the northern part of Asprovouni, by the quaternary sediments of the tectonic valley of Throni and by the south slopes of the volcanic hills north of Throni. The second one is in Agios Nicolaos, north of the town of Methana. The catchment area of those springs is of volcanic construction. The thermomineral water contaminated with the sea water is a percentage of 22% of a temperature between 300 to 40o C. The third place is at the northern coast of the peninsula named ""Palea Loutra"", which is the same as in the second place. The water in all these springs flow some centimeters above the sea level from the pressure of the volcanic gazes and the siphonismus of the ground and sea water through the tectonic lines and karstic erosion of the limestones.
The second group is the water of an underground water horizon by the Methana town, the place of Palea Loutra and, in the west part of the peninsula by the antique town of Methana. That is drinking water of an hydrocarbonate acid composition.

ences, U. s. S.R .
The main compOnent of carbonaceous thermal waters - the carbon dioxide may be subdivided by its origin into some genetic groups. The appearance of 00 2 from depths has the most spreading owing to metamorphic and magmatic processes. The heat influence of magmatic process on the carbonate-bearing rocks of surroundings determines the formation of 002 in the earth crust in addition to 002 which penetrates with magmatic melt.
The physico-chemical data permits to describe the general behaviour of 00 2 in the course of development of the magmatic process. On the experimental data the main separation of 00 2 from the melt must gravitate towards lower parts of the earth crust.
In each region, with calculation of its geological peculiarities, in dependence from the hydrodynamic indicators the volcanic process will be reflected on the formation of carbonaceous thermal waters by heat influence and by possible feeding some portion of primary CO2.

The area of the springs lies about 20 km m\T of the city of Serrai and near the GreekBulgarian border. It is in the basin of the river Strymon, 2 km away from its bank. The area belongs to the Serromacedonian mass. The springs are examined here from a hydrological point of view with relation to the geology and tectonics of the greater area. Undoubtedly the high temperature of the springs relates to the existence of some neovolcanic phenomenae of the area, such as Sitsi-Camen volcano to the north of the springs.

The Thermal Springs of Wadi Zerqa Main, Jordan by John W. Lloyd
The Wadi Zerqa Main is a deep valley which drains a small area of the Jordanian Western Highlands. It discharges to the Dead Sea 17km south of the north shore. 4km above its mouth thermal springs emerge. The catchment consists of a limestone-marl sequence underlain by sandstones. The limestones form the major aquifers regionally but thethermal springs discharge from the sandstones. The valley is controlled by an east-west Tertiary fault and a monoclinal flexture related to the Jordan Rift tectonics. Intruded into the fault in the thermal spring vicinity is a Pleistocene basalt cone. A base flow of 80-100 l/s is present upstream of the thermal springs. Non-thermal waters also discharge below. The thermal springs have a constant total discharge of 400-450 1/ 8 . Thermal spring water temperatures vary from 34 -63 C with the bulk of the discharge temperature above 55°C. No significant temperature variation is 6ecoLded. Regional groundwater temperatures are 16 -20 C. The thermal waters have a total salinity range of 1700-1900mg/1 and are NaC1 in character. They differ from the regional groundwaters which are Ca(HCO
3 ) 2 with salinity below 1000mg/1. Associated
with tne thermal waters are gas discharges from geysers. Gas analyses indicate a common spring source with
CO2'N2 and 0 2 predominating. He and A
are present in minor amounts. Isotope analyses of the thermal waters record 2-5TU indicating a modern recharge. The D/- 180 correlation shows evaporative effects while 14C has a very low activity and 13C is diluted. The modern 3H is consistent with the 0
2 and N 2 gases derived
from modern circulating groundwater. The CO 2 is the result of solution during circulation through calcareous material which is consistent with the diluted 13C and low 14C activity. It is concluded that the thermal spring discharge is significantly composed of modern recharge. The heat anomaly is locally developed and not related to deep groundwater circulation. The anomaly is a deep primary source from which juvenile water enters the area through a discreet fissure zone in the fault associated with the Pleistocene cone,

PRELIMINARY REPORT ON THE RESEARCH OF AIDIPSOS THERMOMETALLIC WATER
By
G. Margomenou - Leonidopoulou
Aidipsos spas are located at the north-western coast of the island Euboea in Greece.
The Aidipsos thermometallic waters belong to the brines. According to the evaluation of the year 1883 the amount of the sprung water reached to 8640 m3/24 hours,while during 1975 were used 5500 m 3/24 hours for balneal uses. The origin is probably due to the penetration of sea water through tectonic breaks to its underground region and to the water spring from the fissures of different depth of the earth. The comparison of the main studies since the beginning of the systematic research till now, shows that in very few of them the place of springs and the temperature remain constant. In most of them the amount of the water supply has changed. Many of them have vanished and new ones appear near the sea with higher temperature.
The recent local research has shown that: 1. the bigger source which is called
""quarry source"" includes seven sources. The biggest of them is a stream with length 15m and width 0.1-1m. This one has at least 8 springs of the following temperature, along the length of the itream, 52,77,78.5,67,77.5,78.8,75.5,78.8. Another source as big as ""quarv source"" called ""upper source"" has almost the same temperature in all of it's springs. 2. some of them appear to have probable existence of organic matters. The conclusion of the above is that the different spring's temperature of the quarry source from 46,6-78.8tis probable due to the ways of quarry's excavation and the probable existence of organic matters needs to be examined for the protection of our sources. I hope that my future research will be the examination of the organic matters.

Scale and Corrosion Caused by Thermal Mineral Waters and Their Prevention
By
Dr. A. Megalopoulos and Dr. Ch. Dimitroulias Athens/Greece
Thermal mineral waters (T.M.W.) lie out of the Ca0-C0 2-H 20 system chemical equilibrium and therefore can cause either scale or corrosion problems to the pipes or metallic structures in contact with them. There are a lot of possibilities and combinations to treat TMW against these problems as. far as they are not •ntended to be used fer therapeutical purposes. In the Contrary cases the means are restricted and the scale formation can be faced by controlling, if possible, the saturation index of the water . (Langeller index) and by the addition of polyphosphates. Corrosion can be faced either by establishing such conditions that a thin dedse CaCO3 layer is deposited on the metallic Surfaces or by the addition of polyphosphates and/or silicates'. Silicates are advantageous because they are free of side effects; but they heed strict conditions in order te)form their protective Cathodic/ anodic layer. In Any case without any treatment TMW waters Cause big technical and financial problems.

EVALUATION OF RADIOACTIVE THERMAL WATERS FROM WEST ANATOLIA AND THEIR MINERALS OF ORIGIN
H. Newesely and M. Andes (Berlin)
Out of a total of ca. 15 thermal sources two independent springs with radioactive water are objects of special interest in West Anatolia. The first, Kestanbol thermal spring, rises at ca. 35 km south of Troy from a N40E stretched dislocation within the syenite occuring there; a mesozoic sedimentary zone in depth of 1 500 to 2 000 m is to consider for the native rock stratum. The output of thermal water is 4-5 L per second, the temperature is 69 to 730C. Besides rock salt and limonite this water contains considerable amounts of'radioactivity, resulting from a certain thorium oxide content. Total mineral content of the water equals to 22,3280 g/L ; the pH value is 7,72 at 20°C. The minerals of origin (constituants of the syenite) are orthoclase, plagioclase, hornblende, pyroxene, biotite and small amounts of quartz; accessories are, evaluated by EDAX and SEM techniques: titanite, apatite, zircone and orthite, as well as uranothorionite and thorite - major sources of radioactivity in this area. But also zircone, orthiie and apatite contain some rodioactivities. The other thermal water source is located 50 km south of Troy, at Ezine, in an andesite layer which is extensively silicified. The dislocations.initiating the permeation of water strain N65E. This thermal source came out after an earthquake in 1956. Here we found the most elevate temperature of thermal waters in Turkey: 102 C. The fountain is of arthesian origin, the water springs up to 70 cm. This water also holds a very high radioactivity, as well as large amounts of salt. The total of minerals is 55,2831 g/L, pH at 20°C is 7,82. Radioactivity is probably induced by syenites present below the andesite massif, but coming not across to the surface in this locality. Apart from the local differentiations, both thermal sources correspond with regard to salt content and radioactivity; both are connected with, waters of lagoonary origin, entrapped in the mesozoic sedimentary rocks texture.

Some Remarks on the Chemical Composition of the Sulphur Sodium Chloride Springs of Kaiapha in the Western Peloponnese
By
Athanasia Papayannopoulou and Alex Letsios, Athens / Greece
The present paper deals with the origin of the sulphur-sodium chloride springs of Kaiapha in the Western Peloponnese.
The authors have investigated the cause of the difference in chemical composition and in temperature of the two neighbouring springs of this area, i.e. spring of the cave of the Nymphs Anigrides and the spring of Geranion.
The cause of this difference is attributed to the greater participation Of fresh karst water in the spring water of Geranion.'
This is shown by about four times greater. discharge of this spring in comparison with that of the spring of the cave of Nymphs Anigrides. The chemical composition of this spring shows a peculiarity regarding the sulphur compounds dissolved by the ground water from gypsum strata.
The reduction (observed some time ago) of the sulphates contained in the spring water of Geranion must be attributed partly to the fluctuation of the discharge of the spring caused by.the meteorological conditions.

THE METALLIC WATERS OF AYII ANARGYRI, CYPRUS
By
Theodoulos M. Pantazis and Sotirios Afrodisis
ABSTRACT
The spring of Pyii Anargyri is one of the most important metallic springs of Cyprus.
This,spring occurs in the Neogene sediments.and is composed of high contents of H2 S and sulphates.
The. geological structure of the area indicates that these waters are not related to any volcanic rocks and have no thermal origin. The high contents of the H 2 S of' the Ayii Anargyri originated from gas known to exist in the form of pockets in the neogene sediments. Such gas pockets are known to 'exist in neogene sediments not only in the above area but also elsewhere in the island of Cyprus. Sulphates have largely originated from the Messinian gypsum deposits which' are extensively developed in Cyprus and in particular in the area under consideration.

METALLIC GROUND WATERS IN THE TROODOS VOLCANIC ROCKS, CYPRUS
By
Theodoulos M. Pantazis
ABSTRACT
The Troodos volcanic rocks consist of pillow lavas ranging in composition from ultramafic picrite basalts through basalts to quartz-andesitic basalts. The Troodos pillow lavas occur in close relation to the intrusive rocks of the Troodos ophiolite suite which occupies about 213 of the island of Cyprus, the pillow lavas forming the outer zone of the massif.
Metallic waters found in the Troodos pillow lavas include high values of • SO4 , but show no evidence of geothermal origin.
The source of the high concentrations of SO4 in these metallic waters associated with the Troodos pillow lavas are the sulphide ores. These ores occur within the Troodos volcanic rocks forming large ore-bodies which consist mainly of pyrite and chalcopyrite. The pyrite, chalcopyrite and other suphide minerals occurring in the ore are considered to be the source of metals of the metallic waters associated with the Troodos volcanic rocks.

ABSTRACT
Thermal underground waters of the artesian type comes up approximately about 50 km. to the South ' of the San Luis Potoso basin. These sate waters drain in subterranean currents towards the north and along one .side of Sierra de San Miguelito penetrating the city of San Luis Potosi from the SE to the NW. Alluvium is the principal aquifer along San Luis Potosi basin. Some kilometers to the south around.the area of Villa de Pozos another current coming from the south turns off to the NE with temperatures up to 33°C and with such great volume that the deep wells in that current. supply up to 30 l/s. The two currents have been located because of the temperatures of the wells and the Hydrochemistry comparison of the analysis of their underground waters. Generally the quality of the water in the 'subterranean currents is useful for most domestic and stock uses, Fundamentally the study has served to find new sources of supply for the city of San'Luis Potosi (350,000 ihhabitants).:

MAIN CHARACTERISTICS AND LOCALIZATION OF
EASTERN AZERBAIDJAN THERMOMINERAL SPRINGS.
by
Ezatollah SALEHI University of TABRIZ (Iran) and Jean SARROT-REYNAULD University of GRENOBLE (France)'.
The Sahrein thermomineral springs are constitued by about twenty springs which appear at the bottom of ,a valley, dug through a thick quaternary pied-mont, which spreads from the south east of the Sabaland to the plain of Ardebil and which covers the heap of the miocene formations again.
Their waters (very rich in CO2) have a temperature, going from 40 to 60 0C and varing during the year, in the same way as the sismic working of the region. Their unitarian discharge are going from I to 15 liters during a second.
The thermal springs of Bouchli, situated a few kilometers far the west of Nir, dress on about 5'kilometers, on a system of very important breakings, cutting the sedimentary and tertiary volcanic formations (miocene) again.
The springs (about thrity) produce them at the bottom of the valleys, on the slopes or also at the top of the hills. A very strong gaseous release of CO2 can be seen in all the springs which are often surrounded by travertins or tuffs. Their temperatures are also included between 40 and 600C.
The springs of Mechkin, on the N.W. slope of the Sabaland are alsb hot (65 0C) and very rich in SH2.
The whole of these hydrothermal arrivals is fasten with a thermic anomaly owed by the Sabaland volcano and by the large surrounding breakings. They settle the last volcanic manifestation which began in the eocene period in this region.
The waters come from a mixture of the meteoric waters, infiltrated in the Sabaland slopes (where the rain is abundant) with the gases going by the big breakings again, which affect the tertiary basin of the eastern Azerbaidjan. The working of these breakings is fasten with the working of the eastern mediterranean,sea.

\ UN NOUVEAU GEOTHERMOMETRE POUR LE CALCUL DE LA TEMPERATURE DE L'EAU DES SOURCES THERMOMINERALES A LEUR-ORIGINE PROFONDE. par Marc SCHOELLER.
Resume : Nous utilisons un nouveau geothermometre donnant des temperatures plus elevees. Ii est base sur l'equilibre permanent entre la composition chimique d'une roche cristalline et celle de l'eau, dans le cas d'un phenomene de longue duree. Les resultats obtenus avec ce nouveau geothermometre ne sont pas incompatibles avec les conditions geologiques, avec les possibilites de cheminement des eaux, en ce qui concerne les eaux des sources du Massif-Central et des Pyrenees presentant a leurs emergences des temperatures inferieures a 80°C.
Abstract : We use a new geothermometer giving higher temperatures.
This new geothermometer is founded upon a steady equilibrium between the chemical composition of a crystalline rock and those of the water, in the case of a very long time of contact.
The results obtained in such a manner agree with the geological and hydrogeological conditions in the case of the mineral springs of the Pyrenees and the Massif-Central yielding water having temperatures less than 80°C.

CHARACTERIZATION OF THE GROUND . WATER HORIZONS
IN BAHARYIA OASES, WESTERN DESERT, EGYPT.
• by ** M.A.E1. Sharkawi B.M. Marbrook
Abstract
The Baharyia Oases is the biggest naturally excavated depression in the western Desert of Egypt the stratigraphic units that makes up the geology of the Oases are as follows:
5. Dolerite intrustions oligocene 4. Plateau limestone Eocene 3. Chalk Maestrictian 2. El Hafhuf formation Turonian-Santonia 1. Baharia Sandstone and vargated
shale Cenomanian
Ground water in the Oases is confined to the Baharyia Sandstone. Three water bearing horizons can be defined.
1. The upper horizon (40-80 m) in depth from the surface with a temperature ranging between 22-300C.
2. The middle horizon, (100-300 m) in depth with a temperature ranging between 28-320C.
3. The lower horizon (280-750 m) in depth with a temperature reaching 46°C.
It is interesting to note that water flowing from natural seepage in the oases show remarkable difference in their temperature. -
This may be reflected in the tapped horizon.
Pumping tests showed that the first and second horizons are hydraulically connected. This feature was also confirmed by the nature of the mineral composition of the total dissolved solids as revealed by x-ray analysis. The upper - and middle horizons are characterized by predommance of Halite and calcite whereas its lower horizon by Gypsum.

ACRATOTHERMAE IN THE BALKAN PENINSULA
K.D. Shterev, Eng. Dr. Sc., Bulgaria
The main place among the hydromineral resources in the Balkans is occupied by the acratothermae (thermal waters with 0, 1-1, 5 g/dm 3 mineralization, layer temperature 25 - 110°C and nitrogen gas contents). Some of them are distinguished by a higher content of silicium, hydrosulphur, F, Rn, or other elements. The acratothermae are of a meteoric origin and their relation to the endogenic processes is only thermal. Standard acratothermae are formed in the washed out rocks with no contents of evaporites and no penetration of endogenic CO ? . Three types of acratoghermae are differentiated with respect both to substance and space: ""Silite"" (in silicate rocks), ""Karstic"" (in carbonate rocks) and ""Territe"" (in terrigenoclastic rocks). Deposits and basins of acratothermae are formed only in geological structures activated by ascending and differential motions and the connected Artesian slopes, intermountain depressions and grabens. The karstic and territe acratothermae deposits are water-bearing horizons in short and long artesian slopes, folds, scales, intermountain depressions and grabens. Silite acratothermals are formed in activated massifs - hosts surrounded by fault drenage zones or grabens. There are also deposits of an ""Aegean"" type of karstic thermal water, containing waters of the present sea basins as well. The outline of the Acratothermae province of the Balkans includes the activated.structures of Rodopa and SerboMacedonian massifs, the Kraistide - Vardar lineament, the Interior Dinarids, Sredna Gora, the Pannon's depression slopes, some structures in the Balkanides, the Pelagono-Thessal massif and the Moesian platform.

PRELIMINARY REPORT ON THE THERMAL SPRINGS OF EGYPT by Chandler A. Swanberg and Paul Morgan, Departments of , Physics and Earth Sciences, New Mexico State University, Las Cruces, NM 88003 (USA)
The geophysics group at New Mexico State University (USA), in conjunction with Southern Methodist University (USA) and the Egyptian Geological Survey, is currently investigating the geophysical and tectonic pattern of the transition from the stable African plate to the active Spreading center of the Red Sea. This program involves the collection and evaluation of heat flow, microseismic gravity and magnetic •data, and the collection and chemical analyses of the Thermal Springs of Egypt. We report here our preliminary findings on the thermal springs and the geothermal potential of Egypt. There are six thermal spring areas in Egypt having reported discharge temperatures in excess of 30°C. The hottest of these is Ain Hammam Faraoun which discharges at a reported temperature of 75°C. In addition there are eight springs discharging water in the temperature range 25-30°C. These springs are distributed throughout 1) the Western Desert; 2) the Eastern Desert including those near Cairo and west of the Suez Canal, and 3) in the Sinai Peninsula along the eastern coast of the Gulf of Suez. Application of various geothermometers to reported chemical analyses of these thermal waters indicate that nine areas are likely to have a sufficiently high reservoir base temperature (> 140°C) for economic geothermal development for electricity, desalination of geothermal brine, or space heating. Thermal springs in the Dakhla oasis yield Na-K-Ca geotemperatures as high as 250°C although the true significance of this value is unknown pending the analysis of nonthernal waters of the region.

Marine Pore-Fluids of the Adriatic and Ionian Sea Compared to the Mineralwaters of the Subalpin Marine-Molasse (southern Bavaria, Germany) -
by
Dr. Peter Udluft sci. ass, at the Institute of Hydrogeology and Hydrochemistry, Techn. University, MUnchen Director: Prof. Dr. K.-E. Quentin
Summary:
Waters of the marine molasse trough between the margin of the Bavarian and Austrian Alps and the Danube River are compared with interstitial-waters of recent or nearrecent sediments in the Adriatic between Italy and Greece and in the Ionian Sea.
Concentration processes, ion-exchange, and biogenic changes allow a comparison of the waters of the Molasse and the Mediterranean sediments. Especially intersting is the high concentration of iodide, bromide and borate compared to seawater, which occures in both the recent as well as the older pore-fluids.
Exchange processes are of little importance in the younger interstitial-waters but are quite commen in molasse-waters. A disappearance of magnesium can be observed in some molasse-fluids. This can be re,;arded as the endphase of the line of changes which comprise the expression ""Alleosis"".
Biogenic processes are responsible for the widely developed sulfide formation.

'HE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE NEOGENE VOLCANISM IN ROMANIA IN THERMAL WATER SPRINGS
By
St.Airinei, A.Pricajan, T.Bandrabur
Most of the thermal waters recognized over the Eastern Carpathians and Apuseni Mountains areas are indirectly considered as products of the post-volcanic manifestations associated with the Neogene volcanism, as well as the moffetic and solfatarian emanations. Over both the areas corresponding to the two distinct segments of the Carpathian orogenesis, the Neogene volcanism occupies a surface of about 7,400 kms. The rootings of the volcanic edifice took place along the systems of the crustal fractures, constituting through a higher thermic conductivity of the eruptive masses, good ways of the conductive transfer, in a high proportion of the geothermic energy from the deep-seated zones of the litosphere to the surface. This conductive transfer situates the geothermic anomalies in the regions with Neogene eruptive masses. The underground waters which can penetrate into the hot zones are submitted to the thermalization process proportionally to the depth they reached and to the caloric intensity of the respective level. The return of the thermalized waters to the surface is accompanied by loss of heat yielded to the environment (through penetrating convectiv transfer), thus being the cause of the socalled hydrogeothermic anomalies. The efficiency of the transport of the heat by the thermalized waters to the surface is as a function of the depth, circulation
• velocity and thermic conductivity of the rocks along the circulation ways crossed by the waters.

A PRELIMINARY GEOTHERMIC STUDY OF N.E. SPAIN by J.F. Albert-Beltran (C.G.S., Madrid-Spain
SUMMARY
In the geothermic study of N.E. Spain, an extension of approximately 40.000 kms2 has been investigated, with the following operative phases: inventory of thermal springs, geology, chemical analyses of the thermal and surface waters, tritium analysis, chemical geothermometers (Si0 2 , Na/K, Na-K-Ca and albite-anorthite) and calculation of the geothermic gradients beginning from the BHT (bottom-hole-temperature) of the petroliferous borings corrected with regard to the stabilization time of the drilling-mud. An inventory has been made of a total of 1.9 thermal localities with a total of 35 hot springs, the temperature of which oscillates between 20° and 71°C, which are distributed in two perfectly differentiated morphostructural units: Pyrenees and Catalanides. The thermal waters of the Pyrenees appear in association with the peripheral fractures of the granitic massifs, whilst those of the Catalanides are situated in the fault lines which mark the limits of the neogenic tectonic depressions of the distensive system of the Spanish Mediterranean with associated Plio-Quaternary volcanism. The sodium-bicarbonate character of the water predominates, which is verified by an albite-anorthite equilibrium in the granite basement, a reaction which is also used as a chemical geothermometer and which gives results coinciding with the usual geothermometers (Si0 2 , Nail( and Na-K-Ca). The temperatures of the last water-rock equilibrium thus deduced do not surpass 1300, being the residence time of these therMal waters more than 25 years, The geothermic gradients calculated in the petroliferous borings oscillate between 0.24 and 0.72°C/10 meters, corresponding to some flow values of 1.5 to 4.4 HFU. The data referred to has marked the limits of the zones of greater interest for detailed prospection, the investigation of which is being carried out with geophysical methods and with networks of themometric borings.

Geophysical and geological reconaissances of Los Humeros caldera (19°-40' N, 97°-25' W) are currently under way to evaluate its geothermal potential. We shall report primarily on the geophysical aspects of the study; the geology of the area will be reported in detail elsewhere. The caldera is located on the eastern limits of the Mexican Volcanic Belt, it is a circular structure 20 Km in diameter. Various episodes of intense volcanic activity can be observed along the perimeter and within the caldera, all of them have been suggested to be younger than 1 my. Close to the center there is an area containing several fu maroles of dry steam; the ground temperature at the fumaroles range front 70°to 90°C approximately.
Geophysical measurements include aeromagnetometry, self potential, and tellurics at frequencies of 8 Hz and .03 to .06 Hz. Aeromagnetometry shows a strong anomaly at the center of the structure, coinciding with a volcanic cone which is apparently the source of the northern lava flows within the caldera. Telluric responses, as well as self potential measurements, suggest the presence of faults intersecting the surveyed fines; excellent correlation of the faults inferred from such measurements is obtained when compared to fault position as determined in satellite imagery. Two Important faults have been recently identified, intersecting themselves at nearly right angles, close to the center of the caldera; their roll in controlling fumarole and volcanic activity in the area Is In the process of evaluation.

Abstract
The results of the geothermal research carried out by ENEL (National Electric Energy Agency of . Italy) in Sabatini volcanic region, together with the study of the sedimentary ejecta from volcanic-phreatic activity (found in four deep wells and in the outcropping volcanics) led to a reconstruction of therelationships between phreatic volcanism and the sedimentary substratum.The existence of these relationships has already -
been pointed out recently by some of the Authors of the, present paper. Phreatic manifestations connected with deep explosions, such as those occurring in Cesano area, suggest that highly permeable horizons containing confined water existed at the time of these explosions. The presence of a thick impermeable cover in this area excludes the possibility of a' local surface water supply (lakes or rivers).

The Campanian basin between Mt.Massico and the peninsula of Sorrento forms a PlioQuaternary collapse area. From previous -geophysical data this structure has been interpreted as a graben. divided into two units (Volturno and the Gulf of Naples) separated by a buried SW-NE trending limeatone,horst„
Parete 2 well, drilled by ENEL in 1976 to a depth of 1800 m, revealed the presence, below the pyroclastic Phiegrean cover forMatiOn,of a thick sequence of andesitic to basaltic type , lava particularly abundant in the middle to lower part of this well. Despite some evidence of a thermal anomaly in this zone, the geothermal gradient evaluated to 1800 m is on average quite low and seems to be affected by local cold water infiltrations. A re-examination of the available geophysical data in the light of the new well stratigraphic data and logs has permitted a re-interpretation of the situation in the Campanian basin.
For example, the analysis of the- already-existing gravimetric data, in consideration of all the elements mentioned above, has led to the hypothesis that the Campanian basin is affected not only by NW-SE and SW-NE but also by direct' E-W and N-S fault systems; these developed:during the neo-tectonid phases that controlled Campanian volcanic activity as a whole. TO particular,.Parete 'structural high' is interpreted as the raised .edge of a NW dipping. monoclinal.structure, on top of which are the volcanic feature(S?) encountered by the well. This structure is bounded on the Gulf of Naples side by a step fault system; the Phlegrean volcanic activity developed where the latter meets the E-W trending faults.

Abstract
Four wells were drilled by ENEL (National Electric Energy Agency of Italy) for geothermal research in Baccano volcanic centre (Sabatini region), 25 km north of Rome. - A study of the stratigraphy and mineralization of the local series led to the following: - the series comprises a thick complex of Qua-
ternary volcanites (mainly pyroclastic breccias from phreatic explosions) overlying an allochthonous, impermeable shaly-calcareous flysch complex (average thickness 800-1000 m); the latter is overthrust on a basal carbonate complex of Eocene to Middle Lias age;
the basal complex is characterized by veins, geodes and aggregates of secondary minerals. Their study by SEM and other techniques gave indirect information on the nature and temperature of the deep circulating fluids. Paragenesis of the dolomite-quartz-K-feldspar-ankerite-anhydrite type shows that fluid temperature at depth was below 450 °C and in most instances below 350 °C;
the geothermal data indicate the existence of an anomaly within the carbonate basal complex (potential reservoir) which extends for some km2 at least. The temperature differences recorded in the four wells are essentially due to local convective circulation connected with fracture lines. The latter, in some cases, controlled the settlement of explosive diatremas.

the territory offer thermal water /35-98°C/
exploring possibilities. There are more than
500 thermal water wells giving altogether 160 million m3 thermal water/year. This
quantity assures the heating of green houses of 1,5 million m2 and several thousands of
flats.
In the next years the rate of utilization
should be increased several times in a way

New data on the magmatism of the Phlegrean area Were obtained through the petrographical study of cores and chips from a 1800 m deep exploratory well drilled by ENEL for geothermal research. The series is characterized by dominant lavas associated with subordinate pyroclastic and epiclastic products, and intercalations of neritic or continental psammitic-pelitic sediments. The volcanic activity occurred in a tensional tectonic environment in an area of very strong subsidence. The lavas pertain to a high K 2 0 calcalkaline basaltic andesitic association, with possible transition to shoshonitic types. Most of the volcanics, however, show effects of hydro, thermal alterations. Their intensity, by series of XRD and thermal analyses, appeared to increase with depth. K-Ar age Of the deepest samples is of about 2 m.y.; the most recent formations of the overlying alkaline potassic volcanics have a C14 age between 11. and 42.00.0 years. Problems related to the tectonic setting and correlation with other local similar volcanics are discussed on the basis of new isotopic and chemical analyses carried out on selected samples from various depths.

Contribution of Geophysical Surveying in the discovery of Cesano Geothermal field (Northern Latium-Centrale Italy) Cameli G. M. (ENEL); Mouton J. (C. M. P. ); Toro B. (C N R) SUMMARY Geophysical surveying played a particularly important role in ENEL's discovery of the Cesano geothermal field. Gravity surveying revealed a strong positive anomaly (greater than 30 mgals in the Bouguer 2, 3) running NW-SE and separat ing two important negative anomalies (less than 20 mgals). This indicates a structural high which emerges from a vast tectonic depression. A quantitative interpretation is given by two twodimensional models. On the southern boundary of the gravity anomaly are two negative magnetic anomalies running NW-SE coinciding with conductive electrical anomalies in the volcanic cover and along whichthere are occurrences of thermal water and gas. It is likely that there is a tectonic discontinuity here. Telluric prospect ing revealed a resistant zone which very evident ly corresponds with the positive gravity anomaly. Measurements of the geothermal gradient in boreholes has shown that the biggest thermal anomaly occurs near Cesano. The gradient and the flow are in excess of 2° C/10 m and 7/4 cl/ cm 2 . Geoelectrical surveying revealed several raised structures of a resistant substratum to the south-east of Lake Bracciano. The most cen tral one indicates convergence among the anorna lies found by the gravimetric, telluric, electric and geothermal surveying. The Cesano I well, which produces hot, mineralized fluid and the subsequent wells distinguished by high tempera tures, confirm the geothermal interest.

A CALCULATION OF THE UNDERGROUND FLOW OF WATER INSIDE THE AQUIFER BY THE MEASURING
OF THE WATER TEMPERATURE
By D. Constantinidis Dr. Hydrogeologist
The aquifers of the Thessaly area have been chemically and physically studied so that the underground waters could be exploitable.
Water samples have been taken from many points of water so that a complete chemical analysis or the measuring of the water temperature can be done. Measuring for the transmissibility has been made inside the bore-holes for the making of transmissibility map.
The existence of temperature measuring elements in every point of water made it so that the temperature curves of the underground water in the shallow aquifers allow it to be traced.
A temperature map of the shallow aquifer (15-30 m deep) has been established in the area of East Thessaly.
Comparing this map with the map of the hydroisohypses and with the undergroundwater flow map, we found that the two maps have similarities. These are: In areas where aquifers are homogeneous the hydroisohypses are similar to the isotherms of the underground waters, but there is a difference in areas where the aquifers are heterogeneous.
During the spring, the decrease in temperature of underground-water flow follows the lignes of ground water flow and downstream of the water flow it obtains the temperature of the Earth. So the direction of the increasing of the temperature is similar to the direction of the underground-water flow. In zones where the transmissibility of the aquifer is great because of the great circulation of water, during the spring we have slow increase of temperature downstream the underground flow. But at zones with small transmissibility the increase of temperature downstream of the underground flow is rapid. For this we can estimate the speed of underground water flow. As for East Thessaly the speed is estimated about 120 m/day.

SOME GEOTHERMAL ASPECTS OF THE DEEP-SEATED AQUIFER SYSTEMS IN THE GETIC DEPRESSION (ROMANIA)
P. Craciun and T.Bandrabur
Abstract
In the Getic Depression, the region located within the foredeep area of the South • Carpathians, some sources of thermal waters have been evidenced. Among the formations building up the above geological unit the Senonian., the Miocene and the Lower Pliocene present in some zones conditions favourable for storage of thermal waters• The processing of available data relating to a large number of drillings led to the outline of some sectors displaying positive anomalies with geothermic gradients ranging from 4 to 5°C/loo in. These anomalies are preferentially located within the hydrocarbon-bearing anticlinal structures, and seldom in their vicinity.ln numerous drillings the geothermic gradient has recorded essential variations as to its depth within the Miocene and Pliocene sediments.The interpretation of temperature data in order to estimate the aerial distribution of the thermic field has been carried out at a guiding mark situated at a 15oo m depth. A great part of positive anomalies is located in the western part of the Getic Depression where the maximum va - lues of the geothermic gradients are recorded.
From numerous exploration borings only few of them have pointed to the existence of artesian thermal aquifers. The correlation of the geological structural conditions with the distribution of the thermic field indicates the possibility of the extension of thermal water accumulations also in some sin.clinal areas so far not submitted to any exploration.

VARIATIONS IN RADON .-222 CONTENT AND ITS IMPLICATIONS IN A GEOTHERMAL FIELD
F.D'Amore°, G.C.Ferrara 00 , S.Nuti 0, J.C.Sabroux
Abstract
A description is given of a possible radon-222 enrichment mechanism in the gaseous phase of a geothermal fluid. On the basis of a survey carried out in 1976 on the radon-222 content in the fluids produced by Larderello geothermal wells, an attempt is made at reconstructing separation fronts between vapour-dominated and water-dominated zones. Previous data has led to the hypothesis that this type of front has shifted with time. The possible relationships between radon-222 and other parameters such as radiogenic argon, the oxygen-18 in the fluids and the gas/steam ratios are also considered.
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Introduction The part played by radon-222 in geothermal fields is of considerable interest, especially in view of its possible utilization as a natural tracer in reservoir engineering problems(STOKER et al. 1975). The radon contents measured in the fluid from an exploited geothermal well are a function of many conditions both with regard to the emanating rock and the convective medium that carries radon to the surface.

GEOLOGICAL SURVEY OF THE GEOTHERMAL AREA OF THE NORTH OF NEW HEBRIDES
by M. Demange
ABSTRACT
The purpose of geological inVestigation of the northern part of the Vate Island New Hebrides is the knowledge of the main volcanological and tectonical setting surrounding the hydrothermal manifestations of the north island.
Three main periods of volcanic activity may be distinguished
1) the older volcanism (Miocene) producing principally pumice of rhyodacitic composition. It constitutes a shield volcano overlayed by tuffs generated partially by wave action on pumices.
2) at the same time of tuff formation, a•basaltic volcano (Fatmalpa) appeared,
with thick flows of pillow lavas and hyaloclastitic material, at the top, aerial flows of aa type.
3) a basaltic intrusion (coin hill) of Quaternary age belonging to the active volcanic range of New Hebrides. Most of these formations (1, 2) are capped by coral reef.
All the tectonic structures (horst and graben) are under control of the evolution of the Island arc. The most recent arcs (Plio-Quaternary) of N - S direction are correlated with the formation of a marginal basin; and the up-lift of the N - W part of Vate is correlated with the surrection of the frontal arc.
The hydrothermal area with hot springs (54 0-63°) on the reef or in shallow water is localized on the end of the N - S structure and in the neighbourhood of the early basaltic intrusion; but there is nothing to prevent all the shallow water table to be at the same temperature (about 1000).

HYDROMECHANICAL, THERMOPHYSIC AND ECONOMICAL GROUNDS OF ARTIFICIAL GEOTHERMAL
SYSTEMS
By
Diadkin J.D., Parijsky Boguslavsky E.I. Mining Institute of Leningrad, U.S.S.R.
Creation of the artificial geothermal systems is possible only after effective rock fragmentation between deep walls. With underground nuclear explosives, hydrofracturing and its combinations for this aim preferable variants have to allow us to reduce seismic effect, extend large-block fragmentation zone and decrease the geostatic pressure on it.
Distribution of the rock piece dimensions, .fracturing permeability,, pressure and filtration velocity of water inside the underground boiler is in any case too irregular. Taking into account the rock thermal deformations and water viscosity changing, decision of coupled heat transfer and filtration problem for the fracturing zone is possible only by numerical method. Taking such a method for circulation system thermal regime analysis confirms possibilities heat energy effective abstractions for intervals between fracturing in 20-30m with heating of cold water pumping from surface almost to virgin rock temperature during 10-20 years.
Economic mathematical modelling allows us to determine optimum parameters of circulation systems in different geothermal and economical conditions. For the Caucasus, the Crimea, the Southern Ukraine, Moldavia and other prospective regions of the USSR such heating systems (3-4 walls of 1.§-j 4 km, boilers volume of 75-100 mln mg and 50.10° kcal/hour capacity for 100 C water) are 1.5-4.5 times more economic comparing the fuel plants.
By the preliminary estimation the earth heat energy is ,a great potential-for the future energetics development.

HYDROGEOLOGICAL PROBLEMS IN EXPLORATION AND
DEVELOPMENT OF GEOTHERMAL RESOURCES
by
Jan Dowgiallo United Nations Development Programme New Delhi - India
ABSTRACT
Hydrogeological methods have to be applied in every stage of exploration and development of geothermal resources. At the very beginning of the exploration in an area where hot springs occur, one has to determine the origin of spring waters. This is essential both for the evaluation of the reservoir's replenishment capacity and for the geochemical interpretation of temperatures at depths. As far as the latter problem is concrned, the presence of ancient brines or recent sea waters in the thermal water under consideration may strongly influence the results of chemical geothermometry calculations. An exact definition of water's origin requires as well long-term systematic measurements of spring parameters (discharge, temperature etc). as application of isotope geochemistry with special emphasis put on the deuterium and 0 - 18 content of water itself and its IRI (Isotopic Relictivity Indicator) determination.
The most important problem of the exploitation of a geothermal reservoir is to keep - the proper equilibrium between the amount of fluid extracted . from the system and of water recharging it. Once this equilibrium is troubled, either cooling of the reservoir due to massive encroachments of cold waters or its exhaustion may occur. To avoid such cases an accurate evaluation of stora4e capacity and transmissibility of the reservoir rock as well as of the hydrogeological properties of the cap rock is indispensable. From the other side the hydrologie balance of the recharge area has to be done with special emphasis put on the evaluation'of the infiltration coefficient. This also requires a study of hydrogeological properties of rocks occurring at the surface in that area. Basing on the results of such investigations the proper number of exploitation wells and their yield may be established in order to maintain the stability of temperature and pressure of the geothermal fluid.

THE INFLUENCE OF INFILTRATION WATER ON THE THERMAL GRADIENTS IN LIMESTONE AQUIFERS
by
C. DROGUE and H. UIL
Laboratoire d'Hydrogeologie, Universite des Sc. et Tech. - MONTPELLIER (FRANCE)
ABSTRACT
Thermal profiles are recorded in bored wells, reaching the saturated zone of the fissured limestone (karst region of South France).
In dry periods, the available measurements show relative stable diagrams in the time from 20 in under the ground surface, with gradients between 0,014° C/m and 0,023° C/m. (The thermal conductivity of the solid rock is about 25 mWrC/cm/sec.).
On the contrary, directly after a wet period, some profiles are notably changed and temporary they show an evolution in the meaning of an increase of the fraction of the geothermal heat quantity used for the heating of the infiltration water.
Some evolutions of the thermal diagrams are explained according to the heterogeneity of the fracturation and of the groundwater flow system in these terranes.
In such a way, these observations permit especially to situate in the bored wells the producing fissures and to describe precisely the structure of such an environment.

STUDY AND USE THE EARTH'S DEEP HEAT IN THE USSR
by Ivan M. DVOROV United Nations Development Progranme, New Delhi, India
ABSTRACT
At present high attention is paid to the exploration and utilization of geothermal power in the USSR. In the USSR during the last 10-15 years a nunber of theoretical problem concerning the origin of thermal resources and the nature of heat processes have been elaborated.
In the field of geothermal exploration there are set up the following basic scientific tendencies:
1. Regional diatribution and conditions of formation of geothermal fields in the zone awailable for direct exploration;
2. Fabrication and development of equipment and the methods of geothermal observations;
3. Study of deep thermal processes;
4. Utilization of geothermal energy in different branchs of econony;
The napping of geothermal fields is one of the significant factors. This conception inplies both temperature fields and heat flow fields. Curing the last years definite successes are achieved in this direction in the USSR. For the first tine the map of tenperature distribution on the consolidated basement of the USSR territory is drew up.
Sistematization and scientific analysis of chemical and gaseous composition of thermal waters and of temperature regimes of wells have made it possible to calculate the resources of thermal waters and evaluate the discharge.
The estimation of thermal water reserves is based on the data on the volumes of waters occuring in waterbearing horizons considered up to the depth of 3500 m with temperatures ranging from 40 to 200PC and with mineralization up to 35 gr per litre. Preliminary calculations of thermal water reserves in the USSR gave their total potential discharge as equal to 19750 M9 per 24 hours.
At present the earth's deep heat is utilized in the USSR in the following fields: hot, water supply of living apartments and enterprises, space heating including greanhamses and technological needs in the industry and of agricultural. Thermal waters are considered to be the raw material for the chemical industry-extraction of iodine and bromine and other rate elements. At present the geothermal energy is used for power generation and finds a wide use for balnecOlogical purposes and etc.

A comparison of volcanism and geothermal activity in Iceland and the Mediterranean area.
Ingvar B. Fridleifsson, N.E.A., Reykjavik, Iceland.
The general concurrence of volcanoes and geothermal fields along plate margins is an established fact. The different types of plate boundaries, however, give rise to variations in the geological settings of volcanic and geothermal areas, both with regard to the heat flow pattern and the lithology and thickness of the crust through which magma and geothermal fluids must penetrate.
At a constructive plate boundary, like in Iceland, the entirely igneous crust ages and the heat flow decreases symmetrically away from the boundary. Active volcanoes and steam fields are confined to a 20-50 km broad zone along the boundary, and are controlled by magmatic activity in the 10 km or so thick crust. Low temperature hydrothermal activity is much more widespread; its heat source is the regional heat flow, but the distribution of the hydrothermal fields is controlled by the lithology and structure of the volcanic strata. All geothermal reservoir rocks are of a volcanic origin, although some may be reworked.
At a destructive plate boundary, like that of the Mediterranean, the crust is of a very variable character comprising metamorphic, sedimentary, and igneous rocks, the two former normally being much older than the boundary itself. The heat flow pattern is very asymmetrical across the boundary. Active volcanoes and geothermal fields are spread over a several 100 km broad zone and are controlled by tectonic and magmatic activity in the 30 km or so thick crust. The geothermal reservoir rocks are most commonly metamorphic or sedimentary.
A comparison of geothermal prospecting data from type localities in Iceland and the Mediterranean shows that the interpretation of data is much more complicated at the destructive plate margins due to the structural complexities, the highly variable lithology and the greater thickness of the crust.

THE SEDIMENTARY EJECTA FROM VOLCANOPHREATIC ACTI VITY AND THEIR USE FOR THE LOCATION OF POTENTIAL GEOTHERMAL AREAS.
R. Funiciello° - E. Locardi°° - G. Lombardi°°° - M. Parotto°
The analysis of sedimentary ejecta found in the products of volcanic phreatic activity derived from a deep acquiferous, may be of use for geother mal fields prospecting. By means of a detailed study of these ejecta in the area of Cesano (Sabatini volcanic group, Rome), it was possible to:
a) reconstruct the tectonic and litostratigraphic features of the basement; b) single out the units of the basement where deep water circulation occurred; c) deduce the thermality and chemical characteristics of the circulating fluid from the study of the newlyformed minerals.
The picture of the situation as obtained ,from this study was confirmed by the results of deep wells drilled by ENEL for geothermal research,that also allowed to recognize the existing relations between volcanophreatic activity and possible geothermal fields. This method of initial prospecting for geothermal fields has also been applied in the Alban Hills volcanic area. The study of the ejecta from the local phreatic volcanic centers lead to the acquisition of new data on the structure of the basement.

GEOTHERMAL AREAS IN THE MALIC GULF REGION
IN GREECE
By C. GARAGUNIS ( ATHENS )
SUMMARY
Since 1973, research and exploration of potential geothermal areas have been gaining more significance month after month. The thermal mineral springs of eastern central Greece-will, therefore, be discussed under this aspect. Their five principal sites are grouped around extensive main faults in the Malic Gulf area. These are Edipsos - Kammena Bourla - Thermopile - Kallidromion - Ipati.
As well known, geothermal areas could be expected everywhere where thermal springs exist, or fumaroles, youthful volcanoes and frequent minor earthquakes (indicators of tectonic instability of a region) (RONNER'1974: 93-96) - three conditions existing in the Malic Gulf region.
1973, samples of spring waters were tested in the 14C and 3H laboratories of the German Federal Geological Research Institute of Hanover. The tests reveal that every hot spring of this area carries, in addition, very old fresh water. Most likely, these old fresh waters originate from deep Karstic water reservoirs joining the short-term water
' circuit only to a very slight degree or practically not at all. That the entire fresh waters of the hot springs are very ancient indeed, is also corroborated by tritium tests. With the exception of the springs of Thermopyle and of Kammena Vourla, the springs are very poor in tritium, they carry no precipitation. Also, there is a relatively high ratio of magmatic carbon dioxide, confirming the old thesis that the waters are subject to volcanic influence. The quaternary volcano of the Lichades (discovered by GEORGALAS 1936) seems to be their central source of heat.
While the basic geological conditions appear favourable at first sight, the customary parametric tests for the subsurface reservoirs desappoint and discourage us. DI PAOLO and DOMINCO, in unpublished surveys of 1973 and 1974, would not recommend drilling activity in this area.
It is the aim of this study to draw renewed attention to the significance of these geothermal reservoirs. It is well known that geothermal fields should be explored individually with regard to their particular properties and possibilties. Actually, for the geothermal areas in eastern central Greece, there are available only research data which are based, on the one hand, on the macroscopic conclusion on the hydrogeological conditions and on the other hand,on geochemical analyses.

The basin of the Strimon River extends from southern Bulgaria to N.E. Halkidiki.
The resulting facts derived as much from various geological research projects as from the bibliography agree to the noteworthy geothermal properties of the area. These facts are:
1) The great number of thermometallic springs, of which worth mentioning are (north to south): Siderokastron, Nigritis Sochou, Mavra Nera, Zesta Nera and Eleftheron.
2) The tectonic structure which is basically a ray of fissures, in a north-south direction, has its origin in Bulgaria and causes the sinking which here extends the length of the Strimona basin.
3) The numerous volcanic and metavolcanic phenomenae (other than hot water springs and thermometallic springs). which are:
The neovolcanic rock, which as a volume is found basically on the basin's western border. Principal appearances of the rock are at Sutsi-Kamen and at Strymoniko.
The frequently occurring veins of mixed sulphurous ore In Northeast Halkidiki of hydrothermal origin.

THERMOMETALLIC SPRINGS OF GREECE - BASIC ELEMENTS FOR THE DISCOVERY OF PROBABLE
GEOTHERMALTIELDS
By
C.N. Garagunis Athens/Greece
Besides the known geological and geophysical methods for the discovery of hopeful geothermal fields, research on thermometallic springs comprises a basic element for the location of hopeful geothermal fields. Chemical analysis of the water of thermometallic springs or of foumarole and their trace elements leads us to further research and to the localization of the prospective field as also to the Value of the possible temperature.
Applications of this method have led to positive results (discovery of geothermal fields and their exploitation) as in California, U.S.A., Iceland, Russia, New Zealand, Turkey and in Greece, e.g. Milos.
The Attiko-cycladic volcanic arch present a multitude Of springs which are witness to the presence Of a great chained geothermal field.
A similar arrangement of springs in central-east Greece of Malic gulf leads us to the existence of a prospective geothermal field. Similar phenomenae are Observed in Northern Greece.

REVIEW ON GEOTHERMAL DRILLING PRACTICES
The purpose of this paper is to describe in a condensed form the practised techniques in drilling geothermal wells
By C.N. Garagounis and C. Karvelas, Athens
Geothermal drilling methods are Practically similar to those applied in oil field drilling. However an adaptation of the technique and equipment is required to meet the specific conditions in geothermal wells. Drilling rigs are of medium depth but must withstand higher loads than those used in oil fields since for harnessing endogenus fluid, larger casings should be used. Considering the stability of the ground around the well, consolidation grouting might be required for reducing the risk of blow-outs by steam or gas from a shallow depth. Drilling mud, comparatively stable in high temperatures, should be formulated by special additives and a cooling tower should be provided for cooling down. Casing operation is very important in well completion and should be carried out with special care, since difficulties in setting and cementation may be faced. Basic aim of cementation is to fill_u p the space between each casing pipe or between the casing and the hole wall, in order to protect the well from caving of the rock around or erosion of the casing, from the penetration of water from low temperature aquifers. The main difficulties in cementation are caused by the high temperatures which range from values higher than 100°C with maximum at 250°C. Therefore, a selected cement quality having special composition and after passing laboratories tests should be used for this operation. Poor and unsuccessful cementation can cause troubles mainly due to the thermal stresses in the casings which are so severe as to result, even in breakages.

THERMAL FIELD OF MEDITERRANEAN REGION IN ,LIGHT OF PLATE TECTONICS
By
Mohan L. Gupta and R.K. Drolia,.Geothermic Research and Exploration Group , National Geophysical Research Institute, Hyderabad - 500 007, India.
The surface heat flow and the tectonic fabric of the Mediterranean region is examined. It is inferred that zones of compression such as Tyrrhenian Sea, Aegean arc, Eolion arc, are characterised by high heat flow. The Hungarian depression and Blackland of North Apennines are also areas of high heat flow. This seems to have been caused due to the underthrusting of lithospheric plate along with mantle diaprism. In fact the tectonic evolution of Mediterranean region is not the outcome of the motion between Africa . and , Eurasia alone but is the result of the interaction of various microplates as evidenced by seismicity, volcanism, present thermal field (partly) and the other parameters. This intricate process has provided environments for .the concentration of geothermal energy in certain parts like the Tuscan zone of Italy. Other such areas of geothermal resources of interest are outlined.

THERMAL SURVEYS AND NATURAL HEAT OUT PUT AT PUGA GEOTHERMAL FIELD, INDIA

Mohan L. Gupta and S.R. Sharma Geothermic Research and Exploration Group, National Geophysical Research Institute, Hyderabad - 500 007, India
Puga valley, which is located towards south of Indus suture zone, has now been recognised as the most promising geothermal field in India. Surface thermal mapping, has demarcated a 3 sq.km. area that has the maximum heat out put. The sub-surface features saturated with cold and hot water and their boundarieS have been Picked up and shown in the 1-m isotemperature contour maps. The 1-m temperatures in the hot zone, though influenced by insolation and existing hydrogeological features, show the dominative effect of the sub-surface thermal energy. The observed 1-m temperatures outside this zone display normal behaviour. The temperature gradients at 1-m depth in the hot zone vary from 10 to 0.30 C/m. Outside this zone 1-m gradients show strong influence Of insolation and are negative in character. Geoisotherms in 5-10m deep holes follow the shape of ground water table and topography at shallow depths and then in few cases the isothermal surfaces change their behaviour. But at deeper depths (25-80m), in exploratory boreholes this behaviour has not been observed, and isotherms indicate the direction of sub-surface hot water movement. The temperature gradients at deeper wells vary from 5.8 to 0.32°C/m. The heat flow considering the minimuT observed gradient comes to 18 u cal/cm sec.
The total natural heat transmitted on the earth's surface from the hot zone has been estimated using the available data. Total power potential of a shallow geothermal reservoir as detected by the D.C. resistivity ,investigations, and-exploratdon boreholes, has been calculated and given.

The Lavey thermal spring has been known and utilized for curative purposes for over a century. Detailed geological, hydrogeological and geophysical investigations followed by a drilling programme permitted to increase its temperature from 420 to 62 0 and its discharge rate from
50 - 70 liter/min. to 400 liter/min. The geothermal energy of the spring will not be used anymore solely for curative purposes, but also to provide heat to the thermal building complex, to heat two indoor and outdoor swimming pools and to preheat the domestic hot water consumed in the complex. Thus the Lavey spring can be considered as the first successful exemple of low enthalpy geothermal energy utilisation in a country as poorly endowed in this kind of natural ressources as Switzerland.

Numerous thermal springs occur in Switzerland and in the adjoining regions. They show a distinct distribution pattern in relation to the main geological units of the country (from N to S: Jura Mountains, Molasse Basin and Alps). Whereas thermal springs are abundant in the Jura and in the Alps, they do not exist at all in the Molasse Basin. If thermal springs are to be considered as manifestations of vertical permeability rather than the result of strong geothermal anomalies at depth, their absence in the Molasse-Basin indicates that there areobviously no suitable, steeply dipping and more or less continuous fissures and faults for the ascent of hot water in this basin, which consists mainly of shales, sandstones and conglomerates. On the other hand, thermal springs in the more compact ""basementtype"" rock suites of the Jura Mountains and of the Alps are located on or near fracture zones and faults, especially whlere - these intersect tectonic culminations or depressions.
Correlations exist between the distribution of thermal springs and the pattern of recent crustal movements (uplift velocities up to 1 millimeter/ year). The occurrence of thermal springs in a-
reas of higher seismicity is even more striking and can be observed in the whole country. The springs of Lavey, for instance, with the highest temperature in Switzerland (61°) and a high outflow rate (300 liter/minute) are located in _ _ , the Valais, the area of the highest seismicity-in the Swiss Alps. Examples of the direct influence of seismic phenomena on spring systems (sudden rise of temperature and outflow rate after local earthquakes) are described.

THE USE OF SATELLITE DATA FOR MONITORING ZONES OF POSSIBLE GEOTHERMAL INTEREST
By
H. Kaminski+ and..A.M. Tonelli++
ABSTRACT
This paper summarizes the experimental results so far obtained by temporal comparison of thermal infrared and multispectral data in the detection of geothermal zones. The short time repetition rate of NIMBUS and NOAA - VHRR - satellites, yielding thermal information, is employed to estimate through the maps of thermal inertia and by the means of the gradient/radiance function the zones where probably an anomalous heat flow exists, while the relatively long time repetition of ERTS satellite is used to discover the chemical microclimate induced at the surface by an endogenous source of heat.
A comparison is made between the resulting inertia anomalies and by the seasonal variation of the vegetation reflectivity over a zone of Central Italy at a 1:500.000 scale.

GEOTHERMALS FUNDAMENTAL MECHANISMS IN OIL AND GAS BEARING STRUCTURES
By
Theodore Karalis, Chair of Soil Mechanics and Foundations, University of Patras-Greece
Despite the difficulties of heat flow in oil and gas fractured and folded bearing structures the fundamentals mechanisms of natural convection are pointed out.
Namely this paper deals with the movements of the subsurface waters (from freshwater types-to strong brines) which are the result of the existence of temperature gradients in those formations.
The practical incidences_of the heat transfs upon those formations like the creation of thermoconvective movements into the fluid and the effects of pore pressure change on t effective stresses in fractured rock systems are discussed.

RESUME
L'exploitation de l'eau chaude souterraine salee avec reinjection - doublet geothermique -.a ete experimentee pour la premiere fois en 1969 A
Melun en France.
Cette technique consiste a produire l'eau chaude souterraine par forage, a exploiter les calories transportees par cette .eau au moyen d'echangeurs thermiques et a injecter cette meme eau une fois refroidie apres utilisation dans le reservoir geologique d'origine par l'intermediaire d'un second forage.
Non competitive en France pendant la periode d'energie a bon marche qui s'est terminee en 1973, la geothermie a basse enthalpie s'evere aujourd'hui come une source d'energie qui, bien utilisee et bien optimisee, rivalise avec les energies dites conventionnelles.
SUMMARY
Exploitation of underground hot salt water with injection was implemented for the first time in 1969 at Melun in France.
This technique consists in producing underground hot water through a well, in sending the water through a heat exchanger and in injecting it back after utilization in the geological reservoir where it came from by the means of a second well.
Not competitive in France during the low cost energy period which ended in 1973, if well implemented low enthalpy geotermal energy is a source of energy that can now be used for space heating in good economical conditions.

A MODEL FOR PLANNING AND MANAGING HOT WATER SOURCES AND ELECTRIC POWER PRODUCTION FOR A GEOTHERMAL SYSTEM
By
Thomas Maddock James W. Mercer Charles Faust
ABSTRACT
A physical model of a geothermal system is coupled with an economic optimization model to plan and manage a geothermal reservoir. The model is used to determine 1) the number and configuration of wells in a hot water geothermal reservoir, 2) the power plant configuration (number of high and low pressure turbines), 3) the base load electrical power production, and 4) the operating procedures for production from wells. Well discharges are used to drive a power plant which requires a range of pressures and enthalpies to operate. A net benefit economic criterion is utilized in the objective function of a mixed integer program. A set of heat transport equations for fluid flow in porous media and a material energy balance for the
• power plant are embedded in the constraint set. The model was tested for a hypothetical single phase, hot water geothermal field based on data for pressures and enthalpies found typically in hot water systems.

A GEOTHERMAL POWER SYSTEM
Richard A. McKay Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California
Roger S. Sprankle Hydrothermal Power Co., Ltd., Pasadena, California
The exploitation of geothermal energy to produce electricity at geothermal fields which produce dry steam is accomplished by removing entrained solids and then sending the steam directly to turbines which drive electrical generators. A similar, simple approach is possible at fields which produce hot water by using an expander which will operate directly on hot, untreated, corrosive scale-forming geothermal brines or brine and vapor mixtures. Such an expander has been developed to a 62.5 kVA size by the Hydrothermal Power Company, Ltd., and successfully demonstrated as part of a prototype electric power plant at three geothermal hot brine fields in southwestern United States and Mexico, using brines having salinities ranging from 17,000 to 330,000 ppm.
In a new project supported by the U.S. Energy Research and Development Administration, Division of Geothermal Energy, the Hydrothermal Power Company is working with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, to build a 1250 kVA geothermal electric power plant and then to determine its performance by careful measurements using low- and high-salinity geothermal brine and steam mixtures in geothermal brine fields. The investigation will include expander efficiency, corrosion, erosion, scale. formation and control, endurance testing, and interfacing with the well and an electric grid.
Construction of the new power plant has just started and is based on the design experience with the prototype. A survey is now-underway to select test sites where the geothermal industry can join in the performance studies. The power plant equipment will be portable and will be ready to go to the first test site about June 1977. The work is expected to lead to the construction and testing of a 5 to 7 MW power plant.

DEVELOPMENTS IN GEOPHYSICAL EXPLORATION METHODS OF GEOTHERMAL RESOURCES
Tsvi Meidav*
Rapid development has taken place in geophysical exploration methodology for geothermal resources in the U.S., resulting in dramatic increase in costeffectiveness, in the realm of both electrical resistivity methods and passive seismology.
Electrical resistivity methods which have proven useful in geothermal exploration include both DC resistivity techniques as well as passive electromagnetic (telluric and magnetotelluric methods). We have found the combination of the roving dipole method, when combined with equatorial or Schlumberger depth soundings to be a cost-effective technique for rapid survey of large areas. We have developed resistivity transmitters with a 100 kw capacity, capable of probing the earth to a depth of about 10 km even under low resistivity conditions, which are particularly useful in geothermal exploration.
It is found that the combination of telluric with magnetotelluric surveys can provide a highly useful combination which results in increased overall program effectiveness under difficult terrain conditions.
Microearthquake seismology is being employed in the U.S. as an added technique for locating active, potentially permeable faults in area which have been identified as possessing a geothermal potential. Radiotelemetered arrays are normally employed to provide the high time resolution required in such surveys.
Examples of utilization of resistivity, telluric, and magnetotelluric and seismological surveys are shown, to demonstrate the mode of application of each in exploration for geothermal energy.

GEOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL ENERGY POTENTIAL OF THE AZORES ISLANDS
By
Tsvi Meidavi and Victor H. Forjaz 2
The Azores Islands lie at the intersection of two geologically active systems, the midAtlantic ridge and the East Azores Fracture Zone, which is linked to the Alpine Orogeny. Active crustal spreading is presently taking place in the Azorean archipelago, accompanied by active volcanism and high levels of seismicity.
Volcanism and magmatic convection may be considered as being continuously present in the region, as evidenced by the numerous historic eruptions, major earthquakes, ongoing rifting, formation of new volcanoes and classical geothermal manifestations, such as hot springs and fumaroles.
The geothermal energy potential of the islands varies from excellent (on San Miguel and Terceira) to moderate (Fayal, Graciosa and Pico) to the unknown (San Jorge, Flores, Santa Maria and Corvo).
The acidic volcanoes of San Miguel offer a particularly promising area of exploration, because acidic volcanoes indicate a relatively slow rise of magma through the crust, resulting in the formation of shallow, high temperature geothermal reservoirs.
Fumarolic activity in Furnas, the Ribeira Grande area, Ribeira Quente, and other location, supports this conclusion.
There are no hot springs on Terceira, but an active fumarole, the Caldeira de Guilherme Moniz., which is located in the centre of the island, suggests that active circulation of hot water must take place underneath.
The overall geothermal energy potential of the Azores archipelago is estimated at many hundreds of megawatts. A number of projects of different size are already under way to fully explore and develop that potential.

ABSTRACT
In Mexico there are in the order of 120 hydrothermal alteration zones and the more important ones are located in the north and middle part of the country.
An energetic potential of about 13,000 MW is obtained by processing the data obtained from the chemical analysis of several hot spring waters and mainly from the Si02 and NaKCa Geothermometers. Such potential is similar to the actual installed capacity in the country.

CERRO PRIETO GEOTHERMAL FIELD, MEXICO WELLS AND PLANT OPERATION
By
Sergio Mercado
ABSTRACT
After having done geological, geophysical and geochemical surveys, as well as exploration drilling, the development of the field took place. The first stage consisted of drilling holes of sufficient production to feed a 75 MW Geothermal Plant, whose commercial operation was initiated in April 1973. The second stage in which we are now working, consists of having installed a total of 400 MW in 1983.
In order to accept the present project it was taken into account the uninterrupted operation of the plant from its installation on, being quite satisfactory the behaviour of the geothermal reservoir during the three years that it has been under exploitation.

Simulation of steam transport in vapor-dominated geothermal reservoirs
Allen F. Moench, Department of the Interior, U.S. Geological Survey, Menlo Park, California
ABSTRACT: A numerical model of steam transport through a porous medium is presented and applied to a hypothetical geothermal reservoir in order to explain observed production characteristics. A vapor-dominated geothermal reservoir is conceptualized as a one-dimensional column of porous or highly fractured rock initially filled with a mixture of saturated steam and liquid water under high pressure. A simple finitedifference technique is used to solve the flow and energy equations simultaneously for temperature and pressure. Analysis involves evaluation of pressure, temperature and liquidwater saturation distributions when steam is produced at either constant discharge or constant pressure. Constant pressure is considered to be a more realistic condition for geothermal systems and permits computation of the dischargeversus-time relation.
Comparisons of computed saturation profiles with previously published results lead to the conclusion that movement in the liquid phase can be neglected at low moisture contents. Production characteristics that can be explained with this model include: temperature and pressure changes when steam is produced at constant or variable discharge, temperature- and discharge-versustime variations when steam is produced at constant pressure, and the existence of superheated steam. Results also demonstrate that temperature changes due to fluid expansion or compression may be significant when dealing with superheated steam.

PRELIMINARY GEOTHERMAL GRADIENT AND HEAT FLOW VALUES FOR NORTHERN EGYPT AND THE GULF OF SUEZ FROM OIL WELL DATA Paul Morgan', D.D. Blackwell', J.C. Farris', F.K. Boulos 2 and P.G. Salib2.
'Department of Geological Science, Southern Methodist University, Dallas, Texas 75275, (USA)
2Egyptian Geological Survey and Mining Authority, 3 Salah Salem Street, Abbasia, Cairo, Egypt.
Geothermal gradients calculated from bottom hole temperatures from over 150 oil wells in northern Egypt and the Gulf of Suez are used to indicate the regional heat flow pattern and geothermal prospects in the area. Gradients of 20-40 mK m- 1 from northern Egypt indicate that the low heat flow province of the eastern Mediterranean (heat flow 30-45 mW m-2 ) extends south into_northeastern Africa. Significantly higher gradients, around 60 mK m- 1 , in the southern Qattara Depression and Siwa Oasis area of the Egyptian Western Desert possibly result from extensive mass transfer of heat by subsurface regional water movement. A range of gradients, 10-60 mK m-1 , in the Gulf of Suez are partially structurally controlled, and the higher heat flow is thought to be related to deep tectonics in the Gulf. This hypothesis is supported by the occurrence of hot springs on both sides of the Gulf. The utilization of geothermal energy is considered most favorable around the Gulf of Suez. It may also be possible to develop the area of high gradients in the Western Desert for the desalinization of saline waters. With the present technology, the calculated gradients do not indicate any possible geothermal utilization in northern Egypt.

THE USE OF THE MT 5 EX MAGNETO-TELLURIC
METHOD 1N GEOTHERMAL EXPLORATION
by
L. M. MUSE*and A. TEN DAM*
SUMMARY
The MT 5 EX is a magneto-telluric method utilising the five standard electro-magnetic components quantitatively by means of exponential solutions instead of harmonic solutions . This new method has been used successfully in its present form in petroleum and geothermal exploration since 1976.
In geothermal exploration and development MT 5 EX has been used in Italy, in Southeast Asia , in the island of Guadelupe, in the western USA and presently in Kenya.
The principal results of MT 5 EX surveys consist in maps figuring the main trend, the conductance along this trend and the apparent vertical resistivity. These maps allow to determine rather accurately zones of prospective interest for further geothermal exploration, whether they are in volcanic or sedimentary rocks and whether the prospective geothermal field is water- or vapor-dominated . This prospecting method helps to determine the location of exploratory or development boreholes.
The advantages of MT 5 EX over the usual electrical soundings are (1) deeper penetration and greater depth of investigation. (2) increased possibility to pinpoint .anomalies and parti-
cularly adapted to detail work. (3) excellent field logistics.
The advantages over the classical magneto-telluric methods are (1) MT 5 EX gives a practical solution to the entire problem
of terrestrial electro-margnetism due to the analytical methods used.
(2) It gives the main trend and calculates the resistivities and the conductances along this trend. The anomalies so determined are very accurately outlined because of the fact that this method gives numerical values with very little dispersion. (3) For the same depth of investigation it takes less time
to register the tapes and therefore there is a considerably better production.
In comparison with the induction electro-magnetic methods MT 5 EX has a much greater depht of investigation and is not subject to elaborate topographical corrections.

STRATIGRAPHIC AND TECTONIC STUDY OF LARDERELLOTRAVALE BASEMENT ROCKS AND ITS GEOTHERMAL IMPLICATIONS. Puxeddu M.°,Squarci P.°,Rau A.°°,Tongiorgi M.°°, Burgassi P.D.°""
One objective of geothermal research in intensely exploited vapour-dominated fields is the individuation of deeper productive horizons. For this purpose a stratigraphic and tectonic study has begun on the so-called 'basement' in Larderello-Travale area. Paleozoic and Triassic formations have been distinguished. , The tectonic
- setting shows the presence of folding structures and wedges separated by overthrust surfaces where the rocks may be fractured and productive. Comparisons between the Triassic-Paleozoic series of this area and those • in the rest of Tuscany and the Southern Alps suggest two hypotheses on the possible presence of potential carbonate reservoirs at depths below the present deepest wells (27O0 m). In the first hypothesis the whole Paleozoic and
Triassic clastic series is allochthonous and underlain by the Apuan Alps ""Autochthon"",comprising Mesozoic carbonate rocks. In the second hypothesis,considering autochthon-
ous the deepest part of the clastic series,these may be underlain by Silurian-Lower Carboniferous carbonate formations. Both these hypotheses should be confirmed by geophysical research before passing to deeper exploration.

Ir. Vincent T. Radja, Chief Geologist, Electric Power Research Centre, State Electric Corporation, Jakarta, Indonesia.
SUMMARY
1. The Indonesian archipelago is one of the most volcanic areas of the world. In Minahasa, North Sulawesi geothermal phenomenae are exhibited by various hot water springs, fumaroles, mud-pools and solfataric fields.
2. Research on geothermal energy in this area, was started in 1970 with a reconnaisance visit to the eastern margin of Lake Tondano and the fumaroloc field near Lahendong by the Power Research Institute of the State Electric Corporation (PRI), then a combined PRI - the Geological Survey of Indonesia (GSI) and the New Zealand Team in 1971, followed by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in 1973, thereafter an Iceland Team in 1976.
3! When assessing the chemical composition of springs, in terms of chloride concentrations, Cl/B ratios, silica concentrations have revealed the existence of high underground temperatures.
4. The main high temperature geothermal areas are at Lahendong-Linow lake and TompasoKarumenga area. They are thought to be wet steam fields.
5. For future work cqncerning the development of these geothermal areas for the production of electric power the following is considered indispensable: topographic mapping, aerial photos, geological, geochemical, geophysical and hydrological investigations,
6. On the basis of these research works it is recommended for the first stage to start with a . .5 MW power plant in order to familiarize personnel with turbo-generator operation and demonstrate the feasibility of utilising the available energy resources: provided that the current research, explorations confirm this to be feasible,

SUMMARY
Geothermal fluids are 'increasingly being used for multiple purposes going from electric power generation with high enthalpy geothermal fluids to industrial and domestic heating with low enthalpy geothermal fluids.
High enthalpy geothermal fluids generally occur in ""fields"", i.e, in rather restricted areas, which are the result of localised highly abnormal heatflows ( to the presence of permeable and porous reservoir rocks, to a more or less efficient caprock and generally to a positive type structure, No two geothermal fields are alike and exploration methods therefore are 'varied and increasingly sophisticated. By a thorough application of geologic, hydrologic and geochemical investigations and by a careful selection of adequate geophysical exploration techniques, high enthalpy geothermal fields can be sited fairly accurately prior to deep exploration drilling.
Low enthalpy geothermal fluids usually occur in large sedimentary basins and are due to a normal or slightly abnOrmal geothermal gradient. The depth of the aquifer determines the temperature of the geothermal fluid. Exploration methods are much more general, simpler and less localised than for high enthal py geothermal fluids. .
The paper briefly describes the various exploration methods used in both high and low enthalpy geothermai ' exPloration 48 well as their limitations,

GEOTHERMIC FIELD TAKES THE LEADING PART IN OIL AND GAS ACCUMULATION ZONES CREATION IN SOUTH MEDITERRANIAN AREA

Moscow)
1. Thermal regime and its time alteration is the leading factor of oil and gas hydrocarbons formation. The intensity of thermal flux causes the presence of vertical range of the zones of formation and distribution of different composition and condition phase of hydrocarbon accumulations.
2. ""Hot"" and ""Cold"" zones of geothermic field are mapped in the South Mediterranean area (Algerian and Libyan Sahara). The ""Hot"" zones take place in the western regions, they are Tindouf and Ahnet trenches, where geothermal gradients are 17-18 m per 1°C and 20-22 m per 1°C. The ""Cold"" zones are Radames and Sirt sineclises with the geothermal gradient 30-40 in per 1°C. Mineral surrounding analyses and study of organic inserts ability to reflect gives us possibility to propose that paleotemperatures in Tindouf and Reggan trenches exceed the modern ones for 20-30%.
3. Distribution of oil and gas accumulations in the South Mediterranean area is distinctly correspondent to modern and paleotemperature regime of the bowels. In its western regions accumulations of ""dry"" methane of katagenesis lower part are found. Oil acdumulations are mainly trapped in Radames and Sirt syneclises. Discovery of dependence between Geothermic field intensity and hydrocarbon accumulations distribution can be successfully used for differential prognosis of oil and gas accumulations exploration.

AUGITIC ZONING AND THE HOURGLASS STRUCTURE
by
S.S. Augustithis, Athens, Greece.
Augitic pyroxenes have been found in basaltic lava of the Ethiopian Plateau consisting of up to 250 fine zones.
Microprobe point-analysis by J. Ottemann along a traverse, perpendicular to the zoning of the augitic phenocrysts, shows oscillation in the Mg, Fe and Ti contents of the fine zones.
Often two distinct generations of oscillatory zoned augites have been determined; generation I forms the nucleus and is surrounded by generation II.
The oscillation of Mg is reversed to that of Fe and the Ti coincides rather with the Fe. There is little difference in fluctuations between the nucleus of the pyroxene, generation I, and the outer augite, generation II. However, a noticeable increase in Ti content is determined in the outer augite (generation II) as compared with the nucleus.
The oscillatory zonal development of the augite phenocrysts seem to result in the formatiOn of ""Sand Uhr"" structures in some of the studied cases.
In addition, the paper describes the phenomenology of the zonal growths and particularly the anomalies and interruptions in the development of zoning. Also an attempt is made to understand the presence of orientated and at random occurring fine needles in respect to the oscillatory zoning of the pyroxenes.
Furthermore, attention is drawn to the relationship between oscillatory zoning and simple and polysynthetic twinning developed in these augites.

Tertiary rhyolitic formation in 33hoclope massif
D.Bahneva-Stefanova V3k1G17Sofia,Bulgaria
Rhvolitic formation is typical of the centre of Rhodope massif, characteristic with granitoid saturation and maximum in Bulgaria thickness of the Earth's crust and granite-metamorphic layer. Volcanic areas coincide with continental volcanotectonic depressions (those of Bratsigovo, Perelik and liitinya), limited by boundary faults. The Perelik depression is of caldera type with a large participation of ring-like and radial faults. Studies of geological and structural features do not confirm the conce pt of the belonging to the ighimbrite or ""plateau-rhyolitic"" complexes. The areal character of volcanic activity is determined by numerous polyfacial volcanic apparatuses controlled by the point of intersection of regional faults. Extrusive-effusive lavas are predominant, and subvolcanic rhyolites, ignimbrites, lava-braccias and pyroclastics are of subordinate importance. Characteristic petrologic features: high (about 50%) and stable content of phenocrysts, porphyroclastic appearance; specifid structures (ighispumitic, microfluidal, microporous and pseudo-ash structure); Caalkaline chemical composition and stability of the petrogenetic components (Si02 - 70-75%; Al 2 0312-13%; alkali R20 - 7,5-8,5%; Fe 2 0 3 +Fe0 + MnO + Mg0=2-4%). The values of Larsen coefficient (25-27) indicate undifferentiated magmas. Solfataric and hydrothermal argillization is a characteristic type of hydrothermal alteration. The volcanic areas coincide with deep-seated hearth-structures, formed probably by partial melting of the crust at a depth of 5 km to 10 km.

The 1970 Pozzuoli event has promoted the recent developments of seismology on active volcanoes of Southern Italy to minimize the risk in the-more densely inhabited areas. Seismic networks were set up and many field surveys were carried out on the most active volcanoes, mainly at Stromboli and Etna. In this paper the authors deal in condensed form with the time-space distribution of volcanic earthquakes and the nature of vol‘,. canic tremor, according to researches of the last five years.

Some Experimental and Thermodynamic . Evidences Bearing on the Origin of Potassic
Volcanics from Central Italy
By
Dolfi, D., Farinato, R., Trigila, R. Istituto di Mineralogia e Petrografia della Universita di Roma Hamilton, D.L., Dept. of Geology, University of Manchester
The many hypotheses proposed for the origin of the K 20-rich volcanic rocks of Central Italy are reviewed in the light of a new chemical, petrologic and thermodynamic investigation. No single proposal is capable of explaining the observed variations in major and trace element compositions and isotopic ratios, all of which vary considerably, even at a single eruptive centre. We report the possible role played by a primary magma, i.e. one , derived from the mantle by partial melting, in the production of the rocks of the Roman Comagmatic Region.
The liquidus and solidus temperatures of the K20-rich rocks at one bar pressure generallyexceed those of basalts of similar MgO/Mg0 + FeO ratio, which discredits the suggestion that the K 20-rich lavas are derived from abasaltic parent magma. Thermodynamic calculations show that the majority of the K 20-rich lavas studied could have been inequilibrium with a phlogopite-pyroxeniteo source rock at about 9 kilobars and 1125 C or a pyrolite composition at about 35 kilobars and 1450°C.

Radiocarbon Ages of the Santorini Islands and its Volcanic History
Walter L. FRIEDRICH, Siegfried KUSSMAUL Aarhus San Jose
and Hans PICHLER TUbingen
Among the lavas and pyroclastics, which build up the caldera walls of the ringisland Thera and Therasia, three pumice series are particularly obvious. The Upper Pumice Series buried late-Minoan settlements on Santorini; this paroxysmal eruption was dated by GALANOPOULOS (1958) who found an age of 3,370 + 100 yr BP.
The ages of the Middle and Lower Pumice Series are still unknown, but a series of new radiocarbon data indicate that they must be older than 37,000 years. Plant remains which occur between the Upper and the Middle Pumice Series can be correlated with the Kalabaki I and II interstadial (between 37,000 and 35,000 yr BP).
Based on these new data an interpretation of the volcanic history of the Santorini group is presented.

Les manifestations de gaz avec predomination de CO 2 sont aussi attachees au meme cycle. Pendant l' intrusion des plutonites et la formation des corps volcaniques un soulevement du complex rocheux metamorphique et des sediments de pliocene en forme de dome s'etait produit.

KLERKX Musee royal de 1 'Afrique Centrale, Tervuren (Belgium) S. DEUTSCH Laboratoire de Mineralogie et Petrologie, Universite Libre de Bruxelles (Belgium) J. HERTOGEN Instituut voor Nukleaire Wetenschappen, Rijksuniversiteit Gent (Belgium) R. GIJBELS Departement Scheikunde, Universitaire Instelling Antwerpen (Belgium) H. PICHLER Mineralogisches Institut, Universitat TUbingen (West Germany) ABSTRACT. Abundances of REE and Sr isotope data, correlated with major and trace element data are reported for volcanics from seven Eolian islands, representing the major volcanic episodes. According to their major element composition the rocks are divided in three types: calc-alkaline, high-K calc-alkaline and shoshonitic. To each type corresponds a well defined REE pattern as well as a peculiar range of Sr isotopic ratios. The calc-alkaline rocks present low 87Sr /86Sr ratios, between 0.7040 and 0.7045; their chondrite-normalized REE patterns are nearly parallel and exhibit a moderate slope. The high-K calc-alkaline and the shoshonitic rocks present higher Sr isotopic ratios, reaching up to 0.7065; their REE pattern is completely different from that of the calc-alkaline rocks showing much higher total rare earth concentrations and a stronger enrichment in light rare earths relatively to the heavy rare earths. The most fractionated rocks exhibit a strong negative Eu-anomaly. An attempt is made to correlate these compositional variations with the distribution in time and space of the different volcanic units. Moreover, it is attempted to explain the genesis of the different rock-types in the light of the tectonic processes beneath the Eolian arc.

""Acid-base interaction of magma with transmagmatic fluids"".
Acid~base interaction of magma with transmagmatic fluids is one of the most important factors, which along with depth of magma smelting determine the composition and crystallization of magma. The increase in magma alkalinity, caused by the increased K and Na concentrations in transmagmatic fluids, increases the bulk activity coefficients of all basic components (silica). It displaces eutectic and cotectic compositions with their enrichment in less basic components. And indeed, the magmatic rocks-of increased alkalinity are impoverished in the strong bases CaO+MgO~eO in comparison with rocks of normal alkalinity with the same Si02 content. It shows that composition of magma smelted from the crust or the upper mantle is determined by alkalinity of transmagmatic fluids, which is dependent on tectonic conditions. The alkalinity of transmagmatic fluids increase with consolidation of"" the crust and with deepening of fault zones . ., ery important is the- ""metamagmatic debasification"" of magma by transmagmatic fluids, acidity of which grows with ascending and cooling down. In this way magmas are formed, which give leucocratic aplitic and pegmatitic rocks. Sometimes metamagmatic debasification may produce granitic and rhyolitic magmas from more basic rocks of basaltic layer of the Earth. The sulfurization of basic magma in some Cu-Ni deposits with formation of liquid sulfides is another example of metarnagmatic processes.

QUANTITATIVE TEMPORAL SLICING OF THERMAL GRADIENT IN VOLCANIC AREAS: COMPARISON BETWEEN TWO SURVEYS ON VULCANO ISLAND
G.M.Lechi°- E.Lo Giudice°°
Summary A new electronic technique is applied to analize the information coming from a_sur vey of a thermally anomalous area. In particular we surveyed in two different years the crater of Vulcano (quiescent vol cano in south Italy) utilizing a dual chan nel thermal scanner Deadalus. The electrical signals were processed in the derivative function way; t1-is treatment allow us to reach an image describing the distribution of the thermal gradient fun ction. The derived signal was then put into a home-made electronic device which perform •the temporal analysis of the input infor nation. In such a manner we got a series of ima ges (adjusting the parameters of the ma chine)where only the gradient during a selected time interval are described. The comparison between the two situations allow us to control the changes in ther mal behaviour of the Vulcano crater with high accuracy throu the years.

COMPARATVE CHARACTERISTIC AND METALLOGENIC SPECIALIZATION OF THE LATE PALAEOGENICVOLCANISM IN gLRDJLITZA-OSSOGOTO-SHARLLIA REGION
Sl.Mankov, L.Andreeva
In connection with the tertiary tectonic activation Of the Rhodopean massif, considerable masses of acid and middle acid volcanic rocks have penetrated in the Bulgarian-Jugoslavian border region along faults with strike 300 0 and 340°, among high and low cristalline metamorphic rocks. They are developed in four formations: dacite-andesitic, dellenite-porphyritic, basalte-andesitobasaltic and a formation of late subalkaline volcanites. There are many ore mineralizations, connected paragenetically with the tertiary magmatites, forming some ore fields. They are characterized with specific ore elements (mainPb,Zn and auxiliary-W,Mo,Cu,Ag,As,Sb,Ba,F). The dellenite-porphyritic formation has been formed as a result of two magmatic impulses: 1-fine-grained porphyritic dellenites with which the scarn-magnetite and the W7Mo ore formationsare paragenetic; II-oligocene Coarse-grained porphyritic dellenites with which the main part of Pb-Zn ore formations is connected. There are some deposits of Sb,Ba,1F occurring with pliocene volcanites. All these ore formations are characterized by typical adjacent metasomatites.

THE ACTIVITY OF STROMBOLI VOLCANO
by
G. Mariotti, G. Napoleone, P. Quagliata
The Well known volcanic activity has been tested at two different stages recognized as normal and paroxystic, according to direct observation.. The normal activity consists of intermittent explosions of moderate intensity and lasting few seconds,
• whilst the observed paroxysm took place by starting with a sudden increase of inten-
• sity and number of explosions accompanied by an outflow of lava that lasted few days.
These direct observations have been related to continuous recording of the Seismic activity in order to recognize different types of the explosive character's.
The main aim of this survey is dealing with the possibility of identifying any interaction between volcanic activity and the periodical sea movements within the general framework of the hydrodynamics in the crustal structures, looking at crustal movements as produced either by the overburden and pumping mechanism.

NEOGENE MAGMATISM IN THE NORTH OF TUNISIA
AND ITS GEOTECTONICS IMPLICATIONS.
ABSTRACT
This magmatism occurs in a mobile zone, corresponding to the boundary of the African plate and the Mediterranean area, inside the flysch Numidian zone. This magMatism is located in two regions, geographically and petrographically distinct ""les Nefza"" and ""les Mogods"". Two different types of magma can be distinguished: - Acid magma (Nefza): rhvolitic to rhyodacitic calc-alkaline lavas, forming domes, flow-domes, or stratified volcanosedimentary formations; plutonic rocks of aranodioritic composition. - Basic alkaline magma: basalts of basanitictendency (Nefza), basanatic tephrites (Mogods). There are no intermediate differentiation products. Acid volcanism always shows alumina in excess which can or not appear as cordierite crystals. Recognition of this mineral is interpreted as characteristic of a crustal melting process. Alkaline basic volcanism, which appeared later, is less abundant, essentially constituting small size intrusions. In a context of global tectonics the existence of acid volcanism and plutonism can be interpreted .as a result of the collision of the African and Sardinian i plates '(Tortonian), while basic volcanism can be the result of distension and dipping phenomena, caused by the separation between the, African and SicilianCalabrian plates (Messinian, basal Pliocene).

The Christiana Group constitutes the southwestern termination of a tectonic line which extends over Nea and Palaia Kameni (Santorini caldera) to the submerged Koloumbos volcano NE of Thera. Lithologically the three islands Christiana, Askania and Eskhati are made Up of lava flows of andesitic to dacitic composition and a soil/rhyOlitic pumice sequence in the SE of Christiana. The occurrence of exogenous xenoliths at the basis of a pumice layer indicates passage of the rising magma through limestones, schists and granites; rocks which do not otherwise outcrop on these islands. Chemical analysis reveals relatively uniform K/Rb ratios around 275 30, indicating only minor fractionation of the extruded magma.. Increasing K/Si ratios of volcanics from the Christiana Groupvia the Kameni Islands to KolouMboS can be attributed to gaining subduction of the Benioff zone. Marked variations of Cr and Ni, and an unequivocal positive Correlation of these with Mg point to a contamination of-the magma:Atiy ultramafic.matetial.

ORIGIN OF CALC-ALKALI MAGMA SERIES OF SANTORINI VOLCANO TYPE IN THE LIGHT OF RECENT EXPERIMENTAL
PHASE-EQUILIBRIUM STUDIES
E. F. Osborn
Summary: The origin of Santorini and western South.Aegean Arc magma series is examined from the standpoint of courses of fractional crystallization . established for the experimental system -MgO-Fe0-Fe203-CaAl2Si208-Si02. Preliminary data are now available for this system at a constant oxygen fugacity (f02 ) of U.21 bar at both ,l bar and 10 kbar total pressure. Compositional trends of the magma series are plotted as (Fe0+Fe203)/(Fe0+Fe203+Mg0) vs. SiO2 and are compared with such curves for the Thingmuli, Talasea, Mashu, and Cascades volcanic rock suites, and for successive liquids formed by fractional crystallization of a haplobasalt composition in the experimental system at a constant or CO2:CO buffered foo . Comparison suggests that: (1) The primary magha originated by partial melting of peridotite at high pressure, the composition of the magma being that of a minimum on the 01-Sp-Px boundary curve. (2) During crystallization the magmas were oxygen-buffered. (3) Initial fractionation at high pressure (5 8 kbar) developed the high-alumina basalt parent. (4) The subhorizontal, silica-enrichment trend of the curves was developed while spinal was a crystallizing' phase. The western South Aegean Arc and Cascades series have only this trend, indicating that most of the differentiation that formed these series occurred at high pressure. (5) For the Santorini, Talasea, and Mashu series, the position oforigin and the shape of curves suggest that they began fractionally crystallizing at high pressure, then continued at low pressure and at a moderate f02.

ABSTRACT
The most recent volcanic activity
known from the island of Cyprus took
place in Campanean (Upper Cretaceous)
or pre-Campanean times and resulted
in the formation of a thick series
of subaqueous volcanic rocks known
as the Troodos Pillow Lavas.
The Troodos Pillow Lavas based
on the percentage of dykes in re-
lation to pillows and on some petro-
graphic criteria were sub-divided
into three groups, namely the upper,
Lower and Basal. However, these
groups do not represent stratigraphic
units.
Petrologically the Troodos Pillow
Lavas range from picrite basalts
through typical basalts to andesitic
and quartz andesitic basalts with
exceptionally restricted dacitic rocks
with a solidification index (SI =
MgO x 100/Mg0+Fe0+Fe 203 +Na 20 +K20)
ranging from 80 to 10.
The Troodos Pillow Lavas are
characterized by the presence of both
calc-alkalic and tholeiite rock series.

Some alkaline rocks and hybrid magmas of the western Anatolia
Savascin, M. YILMAZ University of Ege, Izmir-Turkey
ABSTRACT
On the north of Izmir, between Manisa, Foca and Aliaga,the calcalkaltc volcanics in neogene age are widespread. The oldest of them trend northeastward and are either in the form of dykes or subvolcanic masses, which are exposed through subsequent erosion. The main compositional range falls in to quarzlatite and quart-latitandesite join. The younger volcanic activities have resulted in a succession of volcano sediments, tuff, latitbasalt, volcano sediments, tuff and rhyolite, which occur repeatedly and form widespread covers. The last units indicate the volcanism to be oriented into a NW direction. The volcanic complex of Foca include thickly bedded, acidic tuffs with abandoned breccia. Alternations of tuffs and acidic to intermediate lavas predominate in the up per part of sequence. The rhyolite and ignimbirite represent the highest sections. The sequence has been overlain by a scoria flow supersaturated with CO 3 . Most likely the boundary represents a time gap. Consequently, the joints and vesicles have been filled by carbonats and additionally by silica. Older lavas with a composition of rhyolite dacite, quarz-latitandesite and the youngest CO3 -rich scoria have been cut by dykes of alcalic magma (rich in K), into NW. The lastly occurring alcalic derivatives are the products of the differentiation and contamination of nefeline- olivinphonotephrite (latite, latitandesite, piroxene-murgearite, quarz-murgerite, nefeline-olivin murgearite). All the compositions include variable amounts of olivine, piroxene (Ti-augct), 'nefeline, plagioklase. The older intermediate lavas contain also xenomorphite of Ti-augit. The presence of Ti-augite and the interpretation of the chemical compositions, depending on the first analysis, reflected the presence of mixing between the calcalkaline and alkaline magmas (hybridization).

Volcanism, neotectonics and postvolcanic phenomena east of Corinth/Greece
by B. Schroeder/Bochum FRG
The andesitic volcanoes of the Cyclades island arc reach the mainland east of Corinth and end at the southern border fault of the Gerania mountains. Only the first volcanic period (about 4,5 up to 2,2 mill, a) affected the mainland. On the isles of Methana and Aegina there occurred a second volcanic period (during the Pleistocene up till now).
The volcanics of the mainland interfinger with sedimentary strata of the Neogene which are affected by synsedimentary fault tectonics and are unconformably overlain by conglomerate beds of the early Pleistocene. Tensional fault tectonics during the Pleistocene reaches 500 m throw and even more. Volcanic rocks occur in two small S.-N. stretched areas.
1.) South of Loutraki a few volcanic vents occur within sediments of the Pliocene/Pleistocene in an intensively faulted area (age of volcanics in detail still unknown, no postvolcanic phenomena).
2.) East of Loutraki the volcanics (stocks and pyroclastic horizons) are predominantly restricted to an intensively faulted dome-like uplift zone now deeply eroded. Volcanic activity took place during the Upper Pliocene (2,7-2,2 mill. a). Recent postvolcanic phenomena (2 ""solfataras"", traces of thermal water) are connected to the main fault at the northern boundary of the volcanic area.
An imaginable ,chance of economic utilization of geothermal energy etc. within these two areas should be tested.

A method for estimation of heat discharge from a volcano
Mitsuru SEKIOKA, Institute of Meteorology, The Defense Academy, Yokosuka, Japan
Kozo YUHARA, Faculty of Engineering, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan
A method is developed to estimate the heat discharge from a volcano and its surroundings, utilizing surface temperatures measured by remote sensing with an infrared radiation thermometer or an infrared line scanner. The heat discharge is computed for the following three categories with the assistance of various meteorological knowledge and techniques using the measured distribution of surface temperatures and other observed data. (1) Latent and sensible heat transferred by the ascending volcanic gas is 'computed, using the data of enthalpy, velocity and density of the gas and the area of pit. (2) Heat emitted from the bottom-floor and the wall of the pit is computed, taking account of the absorbing effect of the volcanic gas fulfilling the pit, according to the method of Simpson (1928). (3) Heat transported conductively and convectively from the underground heat source through the surrounding region of the pit is estimated from surface temperatures and some meteorological parameters, based on a heat budget equation.
This method was used to estimate the heat discharge from the two Ifolcanoes in Japan. Estimated values are 1.3x10 cal/sec from the summi crater of Volcano Mihara, Ooshima and 2.7x10 cal /sec from the Island of Nishinoshima-Shinto, the Ogasawara Islands.

Departement de Giologie, Universite de Clermont-Ferrand.
The 1974 Etna eruption that occurred on the lower, west part of
the volcano is rather exceptional as it was practically independent
of the central main vent activity. Also, the products of this eruption
differ from those coMmonly , emitted throughout historic times. They are
almost aphyric and display a peculiar order of crystallization, charac-
terized by clinopyroxene as a near liquidus phase instead of phenocrys-
tic plagioclase that is typical in all other recent lavas. The chemical
composition is also slightly more basic than that of pyroclastics
contemporaneously erupted by the summit Central Crater.
These volcanological and petrological features are symptomatic of
a deep origin for the departure of the magma from the central conduit.
The eruption itself, however, appears to have been triggered by the
general structure of the volcano. From this standpoint, there is evident
interdependence between the various paroxysms of the past five years
and it is suggested that the volcanic activity into all the details
is drastically governed by the regional tectonics. A model of the
shallow structure of Mount Etna is given that accounts at best for
the precedent observations.

RECENT VOLCANISM IN THE STRAIT OF SICILY Edward F.K.-Zarudzki
Istituto di Geologia, Urbino, Italy
The Strait of Sicily (SoS) was affected by Quaternary-Rec
° ent volcanism in its
central part (3530' to 37°30'N and 11°30' to 13°30'E. The latest, well-documented eruptions occured in 1831 (Graham) and in 1891 (Foerstner). Also some 13, less reliable reports of volcanic activity were made during last three centuries. Today, the volcanism in the SoS is dormant but for its geothermal manifestations.
The Pantelleria and Linosa islands, formed by numerous eruptive cones remain the only subarial volcanoes in the SoS. About 50 other, mostly unstudied, submarine volcanic sites consist of: seamounts, extrusive forms, very numerous dykes, sills and lava flows. The volcanism in the SoS is closely related to strongmagnetic field anomalies which, frequently, are the sole external indicators of its presence. It is also restricted to the area of pronounced Bouguer gravity anomaly reflecting a high topography of the Mantle. The volcanism occurs mainly in the areas of major crustal post-Pliocene tectonics trending WNWESE. The volcanoes populate the strongly faulted upper slopes of the grabens. The dykes and deep-seated magma chambers follow tectonic trends too. The mineralogical analyses of the SoS lavas place them in the strongly sodic group resulting from fractionation of the alcali-olivine-basalt magmas of the upper Mantle. They show little crustal contamination.
The relationship of the Recent volcanism in the SoS with the anomalously high Mantle, the deep crustal tectonics and the mineralogy of the lavas, suggest that it occured in response to strongly distensional episode. Such event may have been brought about by shear stresses along the margins of african and european lithospheric plates.

The Cambro-Ordovician Fossil Mud Volcano of Decaturville, Missouri
R. A. Zimmermann
Abstract
Among the many occurrences of fossil and recent mud volcanoes in Italy, Iceland, Central America, New Zealand, Baluchistan and Rumania which have been described by Glimbel (1879, 1888), Krejci-Graf (1935), Gansser (1960) and other workers, few are of the sulfide bearing type such as described by GUmbel (1879) for Paterno on Mt. Etna, and for Decaturville, Missouri by Zimmermann and Amstutz (1972).
The Decaturville mud volcano is of particular interest because of its occurrence in the center of a circular to polygonal diapiric structure 6 km in diameter, displaying features pointing to periodic stages of deformation (superposed folds, refaulted fractures and offsets) (Zimmermann and Amstutz 1976).
The sulfide breccia of Decaturville shows at least two sets of shears just as in the sandstone in contact with the pegmatite, indicating that the sulfide brecciation preceded the formation of the diapiric structure. The sulfide breccia resulted from the mobilization of sedimentary layers into the higher strata. Textures of various components which make up the mud volcano sulfide breccia indicate that they were not, only partially, or well indurated at the time of mobilization. Angular fragments of sulfides and-wallrock are often covered or cemented with colloform pyrite which formed during and after injection.

Our present knowledge on the Radon geochemistry 'is,. nevertheless, scanty and incomplete. Due to the above reasons a systematic study on Radon circulation in thermal and cold fluids has been undertaken with new and better understanding of the geochemical behaviour of this peculiar pathfinder element. In particular Radon distribution has been studied in many cold and thermal springs from Latium, Sicily, Campania and Tuscany regions. The Radon content has been studied with respect to Uranium, Radium and major and minor constituents dissolved in the water samples examined. It is not easy to summarize the results till now obtained. Briefly there are two main patterns of Radon circulation according to the possibility of migrating in the gas phase, which is highly mobile or in liquid phase; in this case the mobility of Radon is much lower. A factor which plays an important role in determining the final Radon content we find in natural fluids is the intensity of the water-rock interaction and the possibility to migrate from the minerals in which Radon originates to the fluid phase. In the paper all the above quoted problems are discussed in detail and an attempt is made to recognize the main, basic processes which regulate the Radon distribution and circulation in natural fluids.",None,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The geothermal gradient data given here show temperature depth relationships
measured in 75 bore holes in Oregon. Most of the bore holes are east of the Cascade
Mountains, and all were drilled for other purposes, mainly water wells, but they also
include mineral exploration holes and foundation tests. All of the bore-hole data are
presented in tabular form and, for most sites, are accompanied by a computer plot to
show a graphical representation of the gradient.
Nearly al I measurements were taken with a thermistor probe on the end of a
shielded cable 300 to 1,000 M in length, all contained on a portable reel. (A ther-
mistor is a temperature-dependent resistor that changes resistance over severa I ohms
per degree of temperature. Tem perature is thus measured indirectly using an electronic
wheatstone bridge.) The thermistor-cable units were assembled and calibrated at the
Dallas Seismological Observatory, Dallas, Texas using National Bureau of Standards
reference thermometers. Calibration was made between 0°C and 60° C at intervals of
0.005°C. Accuracy in absolute temperatures is probably 10· 1 °C, and resolution between
reading, 0.01 ° C. Multiple loggings of bores using different equipment showed only
minor differences - probably most often due to convection within the well bore.
All of the data were gathered between 1970 and 1974 by R. G. Bowen and other
staff members of the Oregon Department of Geology and Mineral Industries. The Depart-
ment staff worked closely with Dr. David D. Blackwell, Southern Methodist University,
Dallas, Texas, who directed the building and calibration of the equipment used on the
prOiect. Since 1972, the funding of the proiect has been provided bya U.S. Bureau
of Mines contract with the Department (50122129) to study the geothermal potential of
Oregon.
Locations of the bore holes are given by township, range, and section, in that
order, utilizing a method similar to that of U.S. Geological Survey Water Supply
Papers. For example, 19-45-25 means township 19 S., Range 45 E., section 25.
Unless otherwise noted, township is south and range is east as nearly all sites are south
and east of the Willamette Meridian and base line.
This information is released in preliminary form to assist those doing more detai led
geothermal gradient and heat-flow studies for geothermal exploration. It is a part of
amore detailed study by R. G. Bowen, D. D. Blackwell, and Department staff members
that is now underway and will be released at a later date.

This paper, therefore, draws freely upon the work of others and includes certain ideas and concepts which the writer proposes as possible exploration methods in the state of Washington. or unproven techniques worthy of further study in the search for concealed These methods are not new but are advanced as untried ! geothermal reserves.
The present status of technology in the exploration for, and develop-
nient of, geothermal resources was meticulously examined during the 1970 United Nations Symposium on the Development and Utilization of Geothermal Resources. The papers presented at that conference in Pisa, Italy are not generally available to those who were unable to attend. However, the very excellent summary by C. J. Banwell (1970) which was made available to the writer, formed the basis for much of the information contained in this paper.

in the exploration for, and exploitation of, geothermal resources. His review covers most of the pertinent factors in a most excellent manner. As a very crude approximation, the normal geothermal gradient of the earth is around lo C per 100 feet but wide variations are common. It is evident, then, that temperatures of the order of 100° C can be expected at depths of 10,000 feet. Because much greater depths are well within the capability of present drilling technology, considerable thought has been given to recycling of aurface waters through deep wells to exchange the available heat. Needless to say, such operations would be very costly and might possibly require additional tech- -. nologic break-throughs in the drilling and materials sciences and engineering.

and can obscure the geothe-1 response. Not~ever, the clay response is
generally non-ohmic and can often be distinguished by appropriate measuring techniques.
Rocks which are invaded by steam generally do not show the low resis-
tivities characteristic of brine-saturated rocks. Under these conditions the resistivity method is best utilized in evaluating the structural features which may be associated with geothetrnal activity.
A typical resistivity investigation bf a potential geothermal anomaly
would be made with four electrodes. An electrical current, either D.C. or alternating D.C., is caused to flow between the two outermost elcctrodec and the potential drop across the innermost electrodes is measured. Non-polarizing electrodes must be used in making straight D.C. measurements. The resulting values in either method are used in calculating the resistivity for the
t
particular electrode configuration used, and a wide variety of electrode configurations can be employed. However, because of the simplicity of calculation, four equally-spaced electrodes have been used in most d0mesti.c studies. The presence of large 60-Hz. A.C. potentials can seriously interfere with the resistivity measurements.
In making a site study, several depth profiles, or resistivity
depth soundings, are utilized to determine optimum electrode spacing. These resistivity spreads are run at selected stations using increasing electrode .. spacings to a maximum of 1.5 or 2 kilometers. Electrode spacings determined i.

Seismic Methods

Because of frequent velocity reversals in most geothermal areas, the
reflection seismic method may be more generally useful than the refraction method. In this respect a clarification is in order for those who do not routinely work with seismic methods. To be most effective, a refraction survey requires that elastic-wave propagation in the formations show a

Var- * iations in thermal conductivities, emissivities, and microclimates can cause temperature differentials much larger than this. ground noise problems are the limiting factor to infrared techniques. Some measure of control over noise can be exercised by operating in the pre-dawn
hours of darkness, but the improvement is minimal. thermal anomalies from background factors requires a heat flow in excess of two orders of magnitpde greater than the normal geothermal gradient. measurement of ground temperatures, therefore, emerges as a much more reasonable procedure than infrared methods.'

Whole-rock 6l80 values for metagraywacke decrease from approximately +15 per mil near the present surface (+750 m msl) to +2 to +4 per mil deep within the present steam reservoir (-2600 m msl). Deep portions of the metagraywacke reservoir (-2000 to -2750 m msl) are recrystallized to a biotite-rich hornfels and have 6l8O values ranging from approximately +5 to +12 per mil. A fault-bounded compartment has been identified within the central Northwest Geysers area where the statistics and systematics of the reservoir geochemistry are distinct from both the adjacent areas and the remainder of The Geysers. Within the reservoir portion of the fault-bounded compartment, the 6l80 values decrease from an average of about +12 per mil near the top of the steam reservoir, to a minimum of +8 per mil in the deepest portion of the drilled reservoir (-2164 m msl). Median and mean 6l80 values from the metagraywacke reservoir indicate that the fault-bounded reservoir compartment is about 2 per mil less isotopically exchanged than any other producing section of The Geysers reservoir. The hornfelsic metagraywacke within this faultbounded compartment is host to a high-temperature vapordominated reservoir (HTVDR) and the 6l80 values range from +8 to +13 per mil showing little or no systematic relationship to depth. The fault-bounded compartment, unlike the Southeast Geysers area, has not been flushed by meteoric water. High noncondensible gas contents (up to 7 wt%), connate/metamorphic water, enriched 6l80 steam values (up to +2.5 per mil), and magmatic-derived helium and argon are found. A strong conductive component to heat flow is also present and with other data, suggests that venting, convection and flushing have been minimal. Outside of this fault-bounded compartment, the Northwest Geysers reservoir appears to be wellvented and flushed by meteoric water; surficial vents with advanced argillic alteration are present; the 6l80 values of steam are 0 to -6 per mil; noncondensible gas values are 2 wt% or less; and reservoir temperatures exceed 300°C. High temperature (>3OO0C) conditions are suspected to underlie most, if not all, of the Northwest Geysers. However, the most peculiar geochemical conditions at The Geysers are localized within the faul t-bounded reservoir compartment where, convection and flushing are minimal. .

In Germany, resources for deep geothermal energy can be clustered along their regional appearance: The North German basin, the South German Molasse Basin, and the Upper Rhine Valley in the south-western part of the country. In turn, all three areas are characterized by different approaches of technical development – the hot-fractured-rock (HFR) technique, the utilization of existing hydrothermal water sources as well as the utilization of circulating water in fault zones. The four German geothermal power plants are primarily focused on the utilization of subsurface thermal water, albeit that the respective power plant`s technical alignment is brought into accordance with the underlying geological conditions.",Potential of Geothermal Energy in Germany,"According to VDI 4640 (guideline of the association of german engineers, number 4640), geothermal energy is defined as energy stored underneath the surface in the form of thermal heat. In Germany, a clear distinction is made between two areas for utilization: All drillings as well as the following usages of geothermal energy – heating and cooling of buildings – up to a maximum depth of 400 m are classified as shallow drillings for geothermal energy. Energy derived from below this depth is mainly used for electricity production.
The potential for geothermal electricity in Germany is shared by the following three regions: The North German basin, the Upper Rhine Valley, and the South German Molasse Basin (Figure 1). The regions can be divided according to the different forms of thermal energy: hydrothermal reservoirs, fault zones and crystalline rocks. The latter can be made accessible by applying the hot-fractured-rock (HFR) technique, which should be induced by a man-made heat exchanger in the bedrock.
The utilization of hydrothermal reservoirs – development of subsurface hot water – is distributed on different geological units Germany-wide.
In the North are rocks from the Triassic/Rhät and the Middle bunter focuses. Less important are units like the Rotliegend, lower Cretaceous or the Hauptrogen-bunter, which belongs stratigraphically to the Dogger. The aim for the geothermal electrical productions in the area of the Molasse-basin is the formation of Malms

(upper Jurassic). In the Upper Rhine Valley focuses the Middle bunter and the units of Rotliegend.
The potential of the fault zones mainly is additional used by the hydrothermal systems but also with the HFR-technique. These zones provide a higher flowrate in using of geothermal water. Germany has the highest potential related to the crystalline rocks because the appearance of the crystalline basement - made accessible with hydraulic stimulation - is large-scaled. Existing cracks or fissures expand or new ones are created by the applied pressure.
The geothermal power plant design exists basically on basis of a binary system, because the temperature is too low, for example for a direct flash-conversion. The working fluid, which is utilized in these systems, is either organical – then it is an Organic-Rankine-Cycle process (ORC) – or it is an ammonium/water mixture called Kalina-construction (Figure 2).",Geothermal Power Plants,"In Germany, four power plants are in operation
(Figure 3). The power plant Neustadt Glewe is located in the North German Basin and went on stream in the 1994. The hydrothermal aquifer is located in a depth above 2,000 m (Injection 2,335 m, production 2,250 m, distance 1,780 m). The temperature at the wellhead achieves 97 °C. With a flow rate of about 10 to 30 liters per second, electrical energy of 230 kWel is generated. The heat production is about 10.4 MWth and is collected from residents, industrial consumers and a leather factory. The power plant beyond the surface is designed based on an ORC-Process operated with the concept of heat distribution.
The power plant Unterhaching is located in the area of the South German Molasse-basin. It is a Kalina-Cycle with 2 boreholes, as in Neustadt-Glewe. The well used for production has a depth of 3,300 m with a temperature of 122 °C and a flow rate of about 150 liters per second. The water is reinjected after the heat extraction in the
second borehole of 3,864 m depth. As a result of the power plant dimensions, electrical energy of 3.36 MWel can be produced. The thermal capacity of 38 MWth is arranged with a district heating to private or industrial clients.
In the upper Rhine Valley, two power plants exist in Bruchsal and Landau. The geological units targeted by the drilling activities are equivalent. The geological structure of the Upper Rhine Valley presents the most attractive geothermal qualities in Germany. Its geological rift structure makes high temperatures at comparatively

shallow depth possible. In regard to the Upper Rhine Valley, this translates into a temperature gradient which is 2 Kelvin per 100m higher than in the rest of the country (Figure 4).
Geological layers are encountered in a depth between 1,900m and 2,500m.
The geothermal power plant of Landau, which was brought online in 2007, has the binary cycle of the ORC-technique with an installed capacity of about 3 MWel. The produced heat flow reaches 5-6 MWth. The thermal brine extracts with a flow rate of 50-70 liters per second at 155 °C.
In the East of the Upper Rhine Valley, in the city of Bruchsal, a power plant with a Kalina-cycle was completed at the end of 2008. The plant has an installed electrical capacity of 550kWel and the heat production runs at around 5500 kWth. The power plant and the thermal water-cycle are ready for use and actually starts the process of commissioning. In future, the thermal brine starts out at the depth of around 2,500 m with a flow rate about 25 liters per second and a wellhead-temperature of 120 °C. The water passes the heat exchanger of the power plant and the working fluid – Ammonia/Water compound – creates steam and drives a turbine, which in turn produces electricity. The second borehole, a reinjection well, was drilled at a distance of about 1,500 m and has a depth of 1,900m (Figure 5).
The start-up of the power plant is scheduled for the mid 2009 and will be accompanied by a thorough research program focussing on the thermal, hydraulic, mechanic and chemical analysis and an optimization initiative between the subsurface power plant and the bedrock (Figure 6).

30. Hot Springs and Fumaroles, Early Days at The Geysers
by Susan F. Hodgson
Geothermal Field overlap, shaping each other through time. In the first eraof geothermal history at the Northern California site, The Geysers was untouched wilderness. About 12,000 years ago, this era ended and the second began when Native Americans came at the start of what is called the Paleo-Indian period. Now the area was inhabited by humans for the first time. By the mid- 1800s when so many settlers came, six Indian tribes lived at The Indian tribes in The Geysers area Fredrickson, 1974 Geysers: the southern, Central, and Eastern Porno; the Western andNorthem Wappo; and the Lake Miwok. All spoke different languages, had distinct cultures, and lived in well-defined areas of the field (Fredrickson, 1974).

Most likely the steam bath in the photo is the one referred to by Benjamin Avery in 1873 in the following passage. “A ravine [near Big Sulphur Creek] contains a clear hot spring, which was formerly built over with stones and sticks by the Indians, and the steam used as a sanitary agent. It is still known as the Indian Spring.”
Robert Thompson told in 1877 how the Indians built scaffolds or gratings over steaming pools, on which they placed the sick, especially those suffering from rheumatism.
Ernest Finley wrote in 1937 that a pool still is called the “Indian’s sweatbath,” and another steam bath used by indigenous peoples is located about two miles below the

Trails open to all the tribes crisscrossed The Geysers. Some trails led to the hot springs and fbmaroles, which were used for healing purposes and may have held ceremonial significance (Fredrickson, et al., Sept. 1978). Early writers noted that archaeological sites at The Geysers often were found near hot springs (Meneffee, 1873).
Castle Rock Springs, in the eastern part of The Geysers, was one of the main hot spring areas. It was used for healing, primarily by the Lake Miwok living near Middletown. This use can be traced to at least the beginning of the historic period. An elderly Lake Miwok knew that the hot springs were used before his time and told of a nearby burial ground that he could no longer find (Fredrickson et al., August 1978).
Although Wappo territory included The Big Geysers-the hot spring and fiunarole area along Big Sulphur Creek where the Geysers Resort Hotel would be located-the area was open to other tribes (Fredrickson et al., August 1 978). Wappo invalids, wrote Stephen Powers in 187 1 or 1872, “were accustomed to wallow in the hot, steaming mud and pools, receiving benefit therefrom into their bodies.”
An ethnographic field survey indicated that the Wappo collected sulphur salt at The Big Geysers. Sulphur salt is what the Wappo called the mineral-rich residue of evaporated hot spring waters. The Wappo mixed sulphur salt with the ashes of burnt stalks of cow parsnip and ate this with acorn bread, c‘presumably for medical purposes” (Fredrickson et al., August 1978). The Wappo word, te ’ke, means “mineral left as a deposit after the evaporation of the water fhm the springs at The Geysers in Sonoma County” (Barrett, 1908). Te ’ke may refer to sulphur salt.
A Wappo village called tekna ’ntsonoma was just north of The Geysers “near the head of the main branch of Sulphur Creek and at a point about 12 miles a little south of east of Cloverdale.” Again, the word te ’ke is defined as above, nan means a well or other deep hole containing water, tso means ground, and no )ma means village (Barrett, 1908).
An ethnographic field survey found that the area around the former Geysers Resort Hotel was held especially sacred, that “its waters were used medicinally to treat a multitude of illnesses. An Indian woman said that her grandmother described the different types of water available near the former resort, saying ‘Every kind of water came out of the mountain, ice cold, lukewarm, and boiling hot.”’
482
The woman said that a Cloverdale man, sick for a year, was cured by the following treatment at this site. Basins were excavated near sources of cold, lukewarm, and hot water, and small channels were constructed leading to each. Proper water temperatures were obtained by opening and closing the channels. On a litter made of willow branches, the man was brought to the area from the Cloverdale Pomo village of Makamo, near the confluence of Big Sulphur Creek and the Russian River. He stayed at The Geysers for four days and four nights, attended by an Indian doctor. At the conclusion, the man walked out without assistance, completely cured (Fredrickson et al., Sept. 1978).
William Bell Elliott, who followed a grizzly bear to Geyser Canyon in 1847, told his grandson, “Pop” McCray of Cloverdale, that the Indians he met at The Geysers had cut shallow niches in the bank of Big Sulphur Creek, which flows on the southwestern boundary. The sick were laid inside the niches on ladder-like stretchers, according to an interview fiom the late 1920s.
Stephen Powers was a writer and anthropologist who visited The Geysers in his travels among California’s Indians in the summers of 1 87 1 and 1 872. His account of their lives includes the following legend that he reprinted fiom the San Francisco Bulletin. The truth of the legend is not known, but the seriousness of Powers’ project suggests that he thought the legend was important.
A LEGEND OF THE GEYSERS
“ I N PASSING UP THE GORGE IN WHICH ARE SITUATED THE PLUTON GEYSERS [GEYSER CANYON BY the former Geysers Resort Hotel], you will notice a human head carved in stone. It bears so striking a resemblance to a half-finished piece of statuary that the most casual observer asks its history. This is the legend as told by the Indians who inhabit the Coast Range:
‘The discovery of the Geysers is a comparatively modem event. From the time when the memory of man runneth not to the contrary, peacefid tribes of Indians inhabited the rich, luxuriant valley of Russian River and its tributaries. With hunting and fishing, with clover, wild oats, and acorns, with the various roots, berries, and f i t s provided by Nature, they lived a happy, contented life. The dense chaparral which covers the mountains and lines the caiions of the region surrounding the Geysers effectually concealed these wonderfbl springs. It was since the
482
Spaniards and Mexicans began to settle the country and fatten their immense herds upon the rank herbage that the Indians were compelled to put forth greater exertions for food. Two of their young men were hunting on the south side of the river, below where Cloverdale now stands, when they caught sight of an unusually large gnzzly bear. Simultaneously they fired their sharp-barbed arrows into the monster’s side. He dropped as if dead, but well knowing it to be a habit of the grizzly to fall to the ground upon receiving the slightest wound, they again let fly their flint-headed shafts, and again struck the bear. Sorely wounded, the animal instinctively staggered toward the thick underbrush, leaving a trail of blood behind. Sure of their game, the hunters followed the blood stains into the chaparral and up the caiion.. . .
‘The sun had moved far down the heavens, and the lofty western mountain shut out his beams fiom the gorge. At sight of their dying game, the Indians gave a loud, exultant shout. .. . In their eager haste they had not noticed the thousand minute jets of steam issuing from the hillside, nor did they hear the hoarse, rushing sound that filled the caiion with a continuous roar, until just as they reached the body.
‘Halting, amazed, they found themselves standing on the brink of the Witches’ Cauldron, in the midst of the hissing, seething Geysers. One horrified, ghastly look at the smoky, steaming hillside; one breath of the puffing, sulphurous vapor; one terrified glance at the trembling, springy earth, and the frightened hunters darted back down the caiion. With stoical skepticism the aged chief and council listened to the tale the hunters told as the tribe gathered around the camp-fire. Earth that smoked! Water that boiled and bubbled without fire! Steam that issued from holes in the ground with a noise like the rushing of the storm-wind! Impossible! But the two young braves were noted for courage and truthfidness, and at last they prevailed on a score of their fellows to return with them. It was all true. There lay the dead bear by the black, seething waters that were hotter than fire could make them. After a thorough examination, the medicinemen concluded that the strange mineral waters must have rare healing properties. Booths of willows were erected over the jets of steam, and the sick laid thereon. The caiion became a favorite resort, and all the Coast Range tribes came hither with their invalids. Many wonderfd cures were effected, and yet, occasionally, things happened that convinced the superstitious medicine-men that the place was under the control of an evil spirit.
‘Finally, one cloudy night, a strange, rumbling sound rose through the darkness, and earth trembled violently. After that no one approached the spot for many days.
483
‘It is a common belief among the Coast Indians that evil spirits fiequently dwell within the bodies of grizzlies. It was now universally believed that the spirit of the slaughtered bear had charge of the Geysers. There were many sick and dying with a strange plague, or pestilence that had suddenly appeared among the tribe. Something must be done. Many urged a return, at all hazards, to the medicinal springs; others held that the angry demon of the gorge had sent the pestilence upon them. At last a gray-haired seer whose hand was skilled in all cunning craft was persuaded to try to appease the spirit by making a graven image near the Witches’ Cauldron. Enough of the idolatrous traditions of their ancestors were remembered to enable them to have faith in this strange attempt at propitiation. Day after day the good old sculptor went all alone to the caiion, and chiseled away the rock until the semblance of a human face appeared. As the work neared completion, he often lingered later, in his anxiety to finish the statue. It was believed that when the task was entirely ended the demon would retire, and let the people be healed. A few more days and the finishing strokes would be made on the figure. Everyone was 1 1 1 of hope. The old man was working at the dawn, and when the evening came and the twilight shadows stole down the mountain and up the ravine he had not returned. Suddenly a weird, hollow moan seemed to tremble on the shuddering air, and at the next instant the earth shook so violently that the cliffs toppled fi-om their base. The terrible shocks were felt several times during the night, and when the sun arose the old seer was gone fiom earth. The cold, stony face of the image alone remained. Not the slightest trace was ever discovered of the f a i W sculptor; yet during the night new springs had burst forth three-quarters of a mile down the river. Here the sick were brought, and fiom that day to the present time the Indians used only the lower springs. Scaffolds are raised above the steam-jets three or four feet, and willows and brush are laid across. On these the sick are placed, and the mineral vapors encircle and heal them.’
“Years after, the white men came to the great valley of the Russian River, and in due time were guided to the springs. The Indian guides would not go farther than the lower springs, but the pale-faces found the image still guarding the ravine. Enterprise and love of gain have built a beautill hotel across fiom the Geysers, and hundreds of tourists annually flock thither.
“The Indians, however, f d y believe that the wrathfid demon still holds sway, and they can never be induced to approach the gorge of the main Geysers.’’
It was this “beautill hotel” that opened the next era of history at The Geysers, the age of organized tourism.

THE RESORT
L E T US IMAGINE WE ARE SITTING ON oak-shaded piazza of The Geysers Resort Hotel, pictured in the comer below in 1870 with the proud proprietor, J.C. Susenbeth. As leaves rustle in the afternoon breezes, we remember the history of The Geysers, the branches of the past weaving through those of the present. We gaze across Big Sulphur Creek at the southern edge of the geothermal field, the same steep canyons crossed by William Bell Elliott in 1847 when, as a member of John C. Fremont’s survey party, he tracked and killed amarauding grizzly bear, Old Slewfoot. Earliest known depiction of The Geysers Resort Hotel. Hutchings ’ California Magazine, 1860
Sources differ for exact dates, but between 1848 and 1854 tourists started coming to The Geysers and lodging was built. Robert A. Thompson wrote that the first was a house called the Old Homestead, built by M. Levy on t a beautifid flat just west of Geyser Canyon. This was the first house in the area. Levy’s flat, which

Thompson said that in 1854 Major Ewing J. C. Susenbeth, proprietor, stands in front of The Geysers Resort Hotel in 1870. His ad read, “A good table is kePt at the Hotel. and the best of Y 1 erected a cloth house across from Geyser liquors and cigars will be found at the bar.” One

Geyser Canyon, site of the fabled hot springs and fumaroles, is in the background. Better roads proved the key to commercial success at The Geysers. In 1869, a toll road was built from Knight’s Valley (east of Healdsburg) to The Geysers Resort Hotel and a stage line was put on the route. In 1874, a toll road was built from Cloverdale up Sulphur Creek, opening for business the following season, according to Robert Thompson in 1877. In 187 1 , a stagecoach ride to The Geysers with Clark Foss cost $6. One halfof a stereopticon view, The Library of Congress
486
The hotel did not prosper in its fjrst decade. William Brewer, a geologist visiting in 1 86 1, wmte in his journal, “Acompany preempted aclaimof 160 acres, embracing the principal springs and the surrounding grounds, built quite a fine hotel on a most picturesque spot, and at an enormous expense made a wagon road to them, leading over mountains over three thousand feet high.”
Brewer adds, “But the road was such a hard one, the charges at the hotel so extortionate, and the stories of the w0nderfb.l geysers so much magnified, that in this land of ‘sights’ they fell into bad repute and the whole affair proved a great pecuniary loss. The hotel is kept up during the summer, but the wagon road is no longer practicable for wagons and is merely used as atrail for riding on honeback or mules.”
However, these setbacks proved temporary. “The first hotel register, kept in 1854, had 20 names. From then on the number increased every year, and in 1875 there were 3,500 names enrolled,” wrote Robert A. Thompson in 1877.
What was The Geysers Resort Hotel like in its prime, fiom the late 1860s to the early 1880s? Major B. C. Truman wrote in 1883, “The hotel was so full during June, July, and August 1882, that people were compelled to sleep in bath-houses and on billiard tables. The hotel building is not at all modem in its structure, but is roomy and airy. There are broad piazzas on which the room doors all open; and Mrs. Shenvood, the jewel of a housekeeper, sees that everyhng is as neat and clean and sweet as a daisy.
“The table is as good as the market can make it; and, in their season, there is fish, and bear meat, and venison. We could recommend no better place for reasonable recreation, absolute re-creation, and perfect rest, than the Geysers. Instead of fashion, there is fieedom; instead of expense, economy; instead of watering-place luxury, country comfort.”
Some found the hotel too rustic. One guest, the beautiful Mrs. Frank Leslie, complained that the hotel was “constructed upon a novel and decidedly breezy plan,” with thin board partitions that allowed guests to hear themselves discussed with “frsmkness and candor.”
Perhaps neither Major Truman nor Mrs. Leslie knew that rattlesnakes were hung outside the kitchen door, valued by the Chinese cooks for medicine and meat.
487
When the resort owner’s children wished to go on a picnic, a Chinese cook would mix Boston brown bread batter in a coffee tin and give them raw eggs to carry. The children would take these to a boiling spring by the side of the creek and put in the bread to bake. In a few hours when it was done, they would boil the eggs and enjoy a delicious lunch.
M e r 1885, the popularity of The Geysers Resort Hotel declined rapidly. During the next decade, unsuccesshl attempts were made to maintain patronage with appeals to lower-income vacationers. One ad called the resort “the grandest, most beneficial for health, and cheapest pleasure trip in the world.” Although the hotel’s great days were never revived, a steady stream of visitors continued for well over 75 years.
Dr. Winslow Anderson noted in his book published in 1890 that “these famous springs [at The Geysers Resort Hotel] have been the objects of wonder and admiration to all the many thousands who visit them yearly.”
Indeed, the guest list shone. Lured by advice that a trip to Northern California was incomplete without a visit to The Geysers, the rich and famous streamed to the resort-ong them J. Pierpont Morgan, Ulysses S. Grant (his daughter-in-law worked in the resort as a chambermaid and a cabin was built and named in his honor), William Howard Taft, Horace Greeley, Theodore Roosevelt, William Jennings Bryan, Lotta Crabtree (the celebrated actress), Madame Melba (the operatic star), Mark Twain, Jack London, Luther Burbank, Giuseppe Garibaldi, and

Benjamin Avery wrote, “The best time to visit Geyser Canyon is early morning, before the sun has risen above the mountain-tops .... Columns and clouds of steam may then be seen rising to a height of two hundred feet or more, obscuring the landscape like a fog just rolling in from the sea.
“One returns to the hotel after a morning tramp through Geyser Canyon and along Big Sulphur Creek with an enormous appetite, and is glad to rest for a few hours. Afterward, there are delightful strolls up and down the creek, and good trout-fishing for those who will go far enough.” Scribner ’s Monthi’y, 1873

These hotel guests, posing by the Witches’ Cauldron, hiked up Geyser Canyon with a stout stick, called a ‘Geyser pony’ to marvel at the steam and hot springs. “Everyone takes a ‘Geyser pony’ ... to help him or her over the rocks and springs, and then all start on the trail single file,” wrote Benjamin Avery. “[On the way] the guide, who perhaps is the jolly landlord himself, points out a chalybeate spring of fine tonic properties, whose waters his guests imbibe, mixed with soda-water.
“The hot ground under the feet [in Geyser Canyon]; thesubterranean rumblings; the throbs and thuds near some of the largest and most energetic steam-vents; the warmly moist atmosphere, filled with acidulous and sulphurous vapors, sometimes charged with strong odors of sulphuretted hydrogen; the screaming, roaring, hissing, gurgling, and bubbling of the various springs; all contribute to make the scene as repellent to some natures as it is grand and exciting to others .... There are no spouting fountains in the canyon, but numerous bubbling springs, that sink and rise with spasmodic action. These number a hundred or two, and are of varying temperature and constituents.” Scribner ’s Month&, 1873

MUYBRIDGE A N D MORAN
T H I S PHOTOGRAPH OF WOMEN COOKING EGGS WAS TAKEN BY EADWEARD MUYBRIDGE AT THE Witches’ Cauldron in 1 870. “The Witches’ Cauldron is a black cavernous opening in the solid rock, about seven feet across, and of unknown depth, filled with a thick inky liquid, boiling hot, that tumbles and roars under the pressure of escaping ste am... that seems to proceed from some Plutonic reservoir. One irresistibly thinks of the hellbroth in Macbeth” (Avery, 1873).
“The rocks for several feet above this infernal fountain, over which its contents have splashed, were covered with innumerable crystals and stalagmites of pale sulphur. In the year 1861 this cauldron, from some unknown cause, was emptied of its contents and filled with steam. The proprietor of the hotel at the place, fearing that it would thus be deprived of one of its greatest attractions, caused a small stream of water to be led into the cauldron, curious himself to see what would be the result. The instant the cool water came in contact with the lower portion of the cavity a fearful commotion ensued. The ground, for several rods about, shook with violence, and in a few minutes after, the inflowing water was ejected with stunning reports, and thrown to the height of nearly one hundred feet. In about three hours after the water was shut off the viscid fluid reappeared, and has continued to boil and bubble ever since” (Cronise, 1868).
In the late 1 880s, another author noted that an explosion at the Witches’ Cauldron sounded like the report of a heavy cannon. When a ton or two of rocks blew fiom the uncharted depths, the noise was heard five miles away.
Eadweard Muybridge, soon to be world famous, was perhaps first to photograph The Geysers. Many of Muybridge’s photographs of The Geysers are well known, yet not the fact that he made them.
After his work at The Geysers, Muybridge invented a way to take sequential photographs of animals and people in motion. Later, working with his locomotion studies on photographic strips, he invented motion pictures .

Another especially famous Muybridge photograph of The Geysers was taken at the Witches’ Cauldron. “A clever photographer, Mr. Muybridge, conceived the idea of grouping three lady visitors about this cauldron, with hands linked, and alpenstocks held like magic wands, in which position he photographed them,” wrote Benjamin Avery in an article entitled The Geysers of Calfornia, published by Scribner ’s Monthly in 1873.
Scribner ’s hired Thomas Moran, not yet the world-famous artist he would be, to illustrate Avery’s article by drawing some of the Muybridge photographs. The drawings Thomas Moran made are widely reprinted and never credited to the artist, perhaps because he signed them with only his initials at the time when his career was just beginning.

Thomas Moran would gain international renown for his many paintings of Yellowstone National Park and the Grand Canyon, which he visited time and again. Moran Point, Mount Moran, and Moran Canyon-famed

“During May 1880, Fred. Somers, a well-known writer; Charlie Stoddard, the poet; Julian Rix, the artist, and another trio of valetudinarians, one day shook the San Francisco dust from their sandals, and hied themselves to the Geysers for recreation and recuperation, which emancipation they must have abundantly enjoyed, according to Somers’ account of their little ‘racket,’ which appeared in the San Francisco Argonaut on May 15, 1880, a portion of which we reproduce, as follows:
‘Inside, the house is partitioned off into male and female departments, with similar accommodations for each. Under the bath-house is a jet of steam, that bursts out of the ground just reeking with sulphur and iron and all the sweet-smelling minerals in the bowels of the earth. Over this jet a half-hogshead has been placed, and, by means of a wooden spout, the steam is conveyed to what may be called the perspiration parlor. Shedding our clothes, we investigated this apartment. It was a sulphur-stained room, with a settee against the wall, and a few chairs with raw-hide bottoms. Forsyth showed us the steam spout, and the adjustable valve, and how, when the valve was pushed in the steam would crawl under the floor, and climb over the back of the innocent-looking settee, and flay you alive. Then, having explained things, and invited us to take seats without cushions or anything, he proceeded to give us a practical illustration. He pushed the valve, and while the conversation went on the steam began to transact business. It came up the spout, and crawled in under the floor, and came out under and over the back of the settee just as has been described, and it made things very tropical. In less than five minutes that little room looked, and felt, and smelt, like a miniature Hades, with Forsyth in the box office. Hardened and accustomed to this temperature, he smiled through the vapor, while the six of us smothered in the sulphur. The skin rolled off in flakes as we frantically caressed our ribs. Every pore was open and howling with the heat. Finally, when the perspiration was pouring beautifully, and we were yelling for forks to try ourselves and see if we were not done, Stoddard broke up the s2ance by fainting. We dragged him under the tepid shower in the next room, and he recovered. Then, red as lobsters, we went through the rest of the performance-with a slight suspicion, however, that we were getting more than the regulation dose. The tepid showers were delightful. The water came direct from the warm springs in the bank, and, tempered with minerals, was as soft and soothing as oil. From the warm showers we filed down a steep flight of stairs and took a plunge into a large tank of sulphur water as clear as crystal, and also toned by the hot springs to a degree suited to the steaming body of the plunger. Here we lay off to cool, as it were, and then, passing under the cool showers, were ready for the divans, or lounges, arranged after the manner of the Turkish baths. Amid the curling smoke of cigarettes we pronounced this natural bath very good.
‘Fresh from God’s Hammam, we felt like boiled angels. The skin was as soft as silk; the liver fluttered with joy; there was a tingling sensation along the spine; and, finally, there succeeded a sleep that tangled up the whole splendid sensation’” (Truman, 1883).

THE LEGEND OF“&PY JACK”
T m s 1922 PHOTO OF “HAPPY JACK” EDWARDS WAS TAKEN AT HIS HOMESITE NORTH OF GEYSER Canyon, near The Geysers Resort. “Happy Jack,” with a long white beard, is standing at photo right. Today, 12 modern wells in The Geysers Geothermal Field are named after him.
Ernest Finley wrote in 1937, “Among the passengers on a stage that rolled into The Geysers [around 19081 was a wealthy San Francisco lawyer. He is said to have gone to the place to obtain relief fiom
arthritis, for one reason, but there was another: his afniction was not limited to physical suffering, and he also sought surcease of sorrow following a romance that had gone wrong. Near the top of the peak directly above The Geysers he built a rude cabin, with only the hard earth as a flooring, and in this primitive abode he lived without companionship for more than a score of years.

“From the day that he entered the region until the day of his death the man never left Pluton Canyon [Geyser Canyon]. Now and then he would descend the mountain to obtain food and necessary supplies. Nature must have soothed the pangs of unrequited love as well as the ills to which flesh is heir in the case of this latter-day hermit, for he appeared always to be in jovial
a mood on visiting the hotel or when curious tourists climbed the mountain to talk with him and inspect the strange conditions under which he lived. In time he came to be known far and wide merely as ‘Happy Jack.’
“The hermit died in 1928 and was buried on the mountain he loved, which had brought him relief h m both bodily torture and anguish of spirit, with the moaning sibilance of ‘Steamboat Geyser’ as a never-ceasing requiem. The site ofhis burial place, . ..

about one hundred feet fhm the little cabin he occupied, which is still standing, is marked by an expensive concrete sepulcher. The stone at the head ofthe vault, conspicuous by its strange surroun%s, bears the simple inscription: John EdwarWHappy Jack’-1928.”
Until 19 12, a stage ride began and ended most visits to The Geysers Resort Hotel. One early tourist wrote at the end of a vacation;
“And we will ride away from the Geysers, grateful that we have seen its marvels and terrors, and the more grateful that the Creator hides from us, by so much ever-renewing loveliness on the bosom of the world, the awful fact which the ‘Professor’ has so concisely stated, that we live on a globe which has a ‘crust of fossils and a heart of fire.”’

to be involved with the drilling and completion of a well only, although important information useful in reservoir engineering may be obtained during this phase. This specialty should cross all three engineering specialties.
Fortunately, there are three good reference books available describinq the functions of drilling, production, and reservoir engineering. Good examples include the text Drilling and Well Completions, by Carl Gatlin, Principles of Oil Well Production, by P.E.W. Nind aGd'-Appl ied Reservoir Engineering, by B. Craft and M. Hawkins. The text by Nind is a McGrawHill publication. The other two are Prentire-Hall publications.
In the light of important cross-purposes in the three major petroleum engineering specialties, it is imperative that engineering data not be taken for frivolous reasons. Engineering data should be gathered with firm objectives in mind. Data-taking procedures should be carefully planned so that the desired information will be obtained, and proper interpretive techniques established. Thus it is basic to review the principles involved in sound reservoir engineering research.
Reservoir Engineering Research
Reservoir engineering generally follows a specific pattern. First, field performance is observed and data obtained. From the observed performance, it is possible to generate a hypothesis as to the nature of the system. The hypothesis is then tested either by operating physical models in the laboratory or by computer investigation of mathematical formulations describing the hypothesis. From these results the physical laws involved in the operation of the reservoir can be formulated. It is also necessary to collect physical and thermodynamic data for the reservoir rock and fluids. These steps frequently involve running well tests. Pressure transient information and fluid samples may be obtained. The fluid samples can be used for pressure-volume-temperature studies in the laboratory, or used to select correlated properties from the literature. Using this information, one can write and solve pertinent equations describing the reservoir system. The mathematical model solutions are usually compared with field behavior to establish the validity of the simulation. Given a reasonable correlation between the mathematical model and the field performance, it is then possible to study the effect of various development and production plans for the system. Final decisions as to development plan are usually based on comparative economics of various operating schemes.
One danger in the preceding method lies in searching for field performance data to match a preconceived notion about important reservoir mechanisms. It is difficult to differentiate between a sound hypothesis and an incomplete mathematical model which includes only selected fact. One good example which occurs often in geothermal reservoir production is the idea that precipitation from geothermal fluids will plug the producing sand face of a well and result in declining production rates. The fact that all

The geothermal resources in Tianjin and its exploitation
Geothermal resources in Tianjin city
Tianjin is situated northeast of the Huabei plain of China, km Beijing. Tianjin City consists of urban district, 4 suburban districts and 5 counties, with 11305 area and 8.4 million population, is the third municipality directly under the central government and an important industrial and commercial city Tianjin has abundant geothermal resources, with 9 geothermal anomalous regions as designated by isopleth of geotemperature gradient 3.5 (Table 1 and and with a total area of 2500 which is one-fourth of the integral city approximately.
The distribution of geothermal anomalous regions in Tianjin
According to the geological condition, the geothermal field in Tianjin can be divided into two categories, i e the Tertiary System reservoir and the bedrock reservoir The reserve of hot water is 787500 million for the Tertiary System and 48000 million for the bedrock (up to deep) Among others, the geothermal field of Wanglanzhuang, Shanlinzi, Wanjiamatou and the tertiary geothermal hot water of the harbor area have better conditions for development, especially the geothermal field of Wanglanzhuang which is near the urban area and was developed early and is now utilized
The first geothermal well was exploited in 1936 in Tianjin. During the early mass exploration of geothermal wells was carried out inside the urban area, and the development and utilization of the Tertiary System low temperature hot water also on a large scale. Until 1985, over 200 low temperature geothermal wells inside the urban district of 960 extracted 22 million
of hot per year In addition, there were several hundred water wells in the shallow layer which were heavily produced, causing large area of surface subsidence of the city; 82.6
each year on an average. Therefore, the municipal government has taken on a project to control the surface subsidence: 678 wells were closed including 154 Tertiary System hot water wells and 524 cold water wells, decreasing the output of groundwater by 60 million per year (including 12 million of low temperature geothermal water). Consequently the subsidence rate of the urban district decreased to 12 in 1992 Until 1992, there are 81 geothermal wells of the Tertiary Group), distribute over the urban district of 460 with an output of 4.24 million each year, in addition, there are also 6 bedrock wells with an output of 1.35 million per year. In the harbor area of Tanggu and Dagang, there are 48 geothermal wells of Tertiary Group), which extract 5.97 million water per year The total extraction of a year is 21 56 million
The direct usage of geothermal heat for heating and bathing produced many benefits, therefore the bedrock well increased rapidly during recent years. June 1994. bedrock wells in the urban district reached 14 (22 including the suburban area), the hot water output from bedrock wells will exceed 6 million and the heating area from bedrock wells will exceed one million
The utilization of geothermal heat in Tianjin
2 1 Geothermal space
According to Tianjin municipal government plan to the year 2000, the centralized heating area will reach 40-60% of the total building area, consisting of 3.37 million by geothermal space heating. For this reason, over the last few years the new exploited geothermal wells are deeper, and they are mainly bedrock and Tertiary Group) wells. By the end of 1992, there were 87 geothermal wells (including 6 bedrock wells) in the urban district. The water extraction per year is approximately 16 million
, and the geothermal space heating area is 0 465 million There are 17 Guantao Group geothermal wells in the Tanggu district. The water extraction per year is 2 64 million and the geothermal heating area is 0 70 million There are 3 1 Guantao Group geothermal wells in the Tagang district. The water extraction per year is million and the geothermal space heating area is 1 15 million The geothermal space heating area of Tianjin city already reaches 2.3 15 million Table 2 shows the circumstances of the bedrock geothermal well for space heating in the urban and near suburban regions in Tianjin.
The geothermal space heating system can be divided into direct heating system and indirect heating system in Tianjin. The direct heating system uses the water which has better quality and less corrosion tendency, whereas the indirect heating system uses the water which has lower quality and heavy corrosion tendency and thus has to use a heat exchanger. Owing to the corrosion, the plate heat exchanger made of Titanium is used, which is rather expensive and is a key point of discussion whether to choose a direct system or indirect system during design for a light corrosive geothermal system For example, the geothermal water of the Tertiary Group) in is light corrosive with the Larson corrosion index of 1.5-1.8, is directly fed into heating system. The average corrosion rate is per year, the total corrosion amount is during the five years period. However, for most bedrock wells, with light corrosive water and the Larson corrosion index of 2.0-3.5, the corrosion rate is rather high if no exchanger used. For example, the Ordovician System geothermal well in Tianjin Geothermal Research and Training Centre of Tianjin University containing 91 1.1 of chloride ion, caused corrosion perforation of stainless steel plate heat exchanger during one Winter period (4 months).
The space heating reinjection doublet well system is one of the exemplary engineering designs for resources protection in where is belong to the Wanglanzhuang A reservoir model has been established (Fig.2) and numerical simulation When the cycle extraction is 216 over 180 day continuous exploitation per year, the distance between the two wells is 1000 m, and the thickness of effective fault is 60 m, it indicates that the temperature of the production well will decrease 3-4 30 years exploitation, the doublet well system is economical and rational. Based this model, the first production well of the doublet well system was exploited in 1993, using an inclined well with inclined depth of 2010 m and vertical depth of 1800 m. The water temperature is 92.5 and the flow rate is 156
and two hot water boilers (each 6 were provided for peak adjustment. In the winter of 1993, the building area with geothermal space heating using a single well had already reached 120000 If heating area used peak adjustment, the area would be over 200000 The operation parameters of the equipment was identical with the design value and it worked smoothly, with part of the water after heating used for bathing. The second
reinjection well of the doublet well system is going to be exploited in 1995. Figure 3 shows the heating technological flow chart of this system.

To increase the utilization ratio of the geothermal energy, and to prolong the life of equipment and improve the economy of system, some technical measures have been performed step by step for the space heating system in Tianjin. They are: establish reservoir model and numerical simulation, (2) carry out reinjection exploitation, (3) substitute 100 heat-resisting submersible pump for deep well pump (4) use multiple function wellhead assembly and high effective removal system for sand and iron, ( 5) use straight piping system of anti-corrosion, water-proof and heat preservation, (6) use large titanium plate heat exchanger with changeable passage, (7) develop software optimize the geothermal system, (8) adopt high effective and cheap valve for temperature control, (9) comprehensive utilization of drain water, and (10) adopt dynamic monitor of computer and modernized management. The geothermal equipments mentioned above can be made in Tianjin nowadays by a number of companies formed for the geothermal industry.
2.2 Geothermal utilization in industry
The early geothermal well exploited was mainly used in industry in Tianjin, being concentrated on textile and dyeing mill, they were

mostly the wells of Tertiary Group), which provided high quality and low temperature hot water for operation of dyeing and washing or used as boiler's water Some industrial utilization cases of geothermal wells in Tianjin are illustrated in Table One example of geothermal water utilization is Tianjin Fourth Cotton Spinning with one geothermal well exploited in 1988. The water temperature was flow rate 298 and flowing pressure 0 24 The geothermal water was used for space heating of different buildings of 45000 area, for air conditioning of workshop of 130000 area, for bathing of staff and workers Fig4 shows the schematic diagram of the geothermal utilization system.
Table 3. Industrial of geothermal wells in Tianjin
Fig.4 The schematic diagram of the geothermal utilization system of cotton
The geothermal water was cascaded through many steps, firstly used for space heating and air condition, afterwards the water was purified, then used for production operation and daily life Concerning the air condition system, a mixture of 10% fresh air and 90% workshop was used, after cyclical spraying (temperature and moisture adjustment) of the geothermal water, the treated air was sent into workshop In this way a large amount of coal and electrical power were saved which was necessary for the steam
supply Through calculation of Enthalpy-Percentage Saturation diagram, an air condition system with a flow rate of 100000 needs 902 of 60 geothermal water, or 601 of 80 geothermal water During 1988-1991, a 3 years period, the system saved 17400 t of standard coal and 1 13 million Yuan of investment, and decreased by 6 9 the discharge of smoking dust, 1 1 7t of and 455 t of cinder every winter
Geothermal utilization in
Geothermal utilization in agriculture in Tianjin is mainly in the fields of winter fry-pond and hatching. There are 17 geothermal winter bases for fry-breeding with the fry-ponds covering an area of 80000 suppling the market each year with 20 million African crucian fry and 10 million carp fry. In addition, there are precious aquatic products such as: breeding prawn, soft-shelled turtle and bullfrog. Meanwhile two large-scale geothermal chicken farm provide 60 million breeding chicken and 200000 t of fresh eggs each year There are several fair-sized comprehensive geothermal utilization system in the suburban districts of Tianjin, which make remarkable benefits both in economy and to society. Especially the villages, which are just breaking away poverty due to the usage of geothermal energy, are most interesting in geothermal utilization in agriculture. There are three different kinds of geothermal utilization bases in agriculture in Tianjin as follows:
( ) Geothermal comprehensive utilization system for agriculture in Tuanbo
One geothermal well was exploited in Spring the depth of the well was 980 m and the temperature of the water was 76
In the following years, a complete set of geothermal engineering designs were implemented, including. 1.3 hectare of geothermal winter fish-pond, 10 greenhouses, one workshop for edible 8 factories with geothermal space heating, 2 geothermal bathrooms, 867 hectare of reed-fish-ponds combine engineering, and one administration building of 4 storeys. The output value produced during 5 years is 44.422 million Yuan, making a profit of 10 839 million Yuan. Also village supplies the market with 1855 t of fish and 70.5 t of fry during this 5-year period.
(2) Geothermal chicken farm in In the early a idle geothermal well (98 water), which was left unused after drilling on the farm, was used to found a geothermal chicken farm, the first and largest one in China at the time The farm owns 4896 of chicken coops, 2 hatching halls equipped with 33 geothermal incubators, with a total building area of 20236 Every year the farm raise 36000 breeding chicken, 5 5 million breeding eggs, and hatch 4 million chicks, whcih enables the output of eggs to reach a considerable amount of 90450 t per year in Tianjin Because of the geothermal heat, the economy of the farm developed rapidly, the total output value is 133 million Yuan and the profit is 9 43 million Yuan in the 9-year period.
A large geothermal incubator was invented by the which can hatch 12672 eggs for each run, the temperature difference between top and bottom of the incubator is less than the hatching ratio is 85% on the average and 95% at the maximum. The incubator is easy to handle, by automatically over the eggs and with automatic controls for temperature and alarm. Achieving good results, the incubator is manufactured for supply to the market.
(3) Geothermal fry-pond in Luqian village This village owns 3 geothermal wells, the flow rate of each is 60-70 the temperature of the water is 47 48 and 50 respectively. There are 4 hectare geothermal winter fish-ponds and 13.3 hectare open air fish-ponds, producing t of fry each year, which have become a important base of supply in Tianjin.
Geothermal utilization in other fields Almost all of the geothermal wells in Tianjin provide bathrooms which are very convenient, save energy and improve environmental conditions. Many higher institutions such as Tianjin University,
Nankai University and Medical University have built geothermal bathroom for their staffs There are two large-scale hot spring amusement parks and three hot spring swimming pools which have been well received by the masses A big scenery spot is now under construction in Tuanbo village, containing 6 geothermal wells to supply the heat energy to many utilizations such as hot spring pool, park, vacation village, sanatoriums, conference centre, aquatic product breeding, greenhouse for flowers and so on
3. Prospect of international cooperation and problems awaiting solution
The direct utilization of geothermal energy in already has achieved a considerable scope, and is developing continuously But there are still some technical questions to be solved, that influences the further usage of intermediate-low temperature geothermal water In order to solve these questions, the goethermal workers in Tianjin should be diligent, but international cooperation is also essential. The main aspects of international cooperation are:
(1) Reinjection exploitation is a scientific way which we must take. How to distribute the reinjection wells? In layer does it lie? What kinds of reinjection method should be taken? What effect
emerge after reinjection? All these need investigation and testing.
(2) It is necessary to establish an integral reservoir model, which demonstrates the main field and exploitation situation in Tianjin at present, to be carried out by numerical simulation. At the same time develop handy software which is suitable to exploit the intermediate and low temperature water.
(3) For developing the direct usage of intermediate-low temperature water, it demands high quality, anti-corrosion, equipment which is durable and cheap. The resolution of these problems is urgent, and should adress the following:
* Heat-resisting nonmetallic pipe: heat resisting under 120 waterproof, anticorrosive, heat preservation, pressure-bearing and durable. The price should be lower than that of the metal one.
* Cheap and durable heat exchanger: Titanium plate heat exchanger has good performance but is very expensive. Investigation must be taken to find a cheap and durable substitution for it.
High efficiency and compact equipment for iron separating: After reacting with air, the two-valence iron become threevalence the water become red, which contaminate
bathroom, ceramic tile and basin. The iron-separating equipments now available are too large and needs a large amount of capital investment.,
* Technique of highly effective anti-scaling compound: some kinds of geothermal water produces heavy scaling, thus, a highly effective and cheap scouring method is essential, to be applied to system of intermediate-low temperature water.
(4) There are over different kinds of geothermal wells in Tianjin, it is necessary that scientific and modernized management should be realized How to control the resources effectively? How to use the ground reasonably? What kinds of technical specifications are needed? How to make a plan for further development? All these should use the experience of foreign countries for reference.
From the Tianjin has camed out multi-aspect cooperation with United Nations Development and organizations from Italy, France, Iceland and New Zealand They have played very active role for geothermal development in Tianjin We wish to achieve more international cooperation, which will enable the geothermal utilization to reach a new level in Tianjin

A major contributor to the high costs associated with geothermal wells is the extensive corrosion of the drill pipe by oxygen present in the , drilling fluid. The importance of controlling the corrosive attack of oxygen in the drilling operation is evident when the cost and availability of drill pipe is considered. A possible method for reducing the corrosive attack of oxygen is the utilization of an inert drilling fluid such as nitrogen. replace air in foam drilling, air drilling, and for the aeration of drilling muds. quantity of it with'a purity of less than 5 ppm of oxygen'at the drilling site. The volume of nitrogen required for geothermal drilling ranges from 8 x l o 4 to 3 x lo6 standard cubic feet per day, thus making the transportation of liquid nitrogen to a drilling site prohibitively expensive. for producing nitrogen on site that are being studied are: conversion of diesel exhaust, 2) cryogenic separation of air.

The chemical interactions between host rocks and fluids, by causing the dissolution and precipitation of minerals, can either enhance or destroy permeability and porosity in the area of interest. Reactive chemical transport simulation of injection should be a useful tool aiding in decisions relating to reservoir management. To assess these interactions and their potential effects on the Coso Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) experiment, modeling efforts using the program TOUGHREACT have been initiated. TOUGHREACT is a numerical simulation program for chemically reactive nonisothermal flows of multiphase fluids in porous and fractured media. The program is written in Fortran 77 and was developed by introducing reactive chemistry into the multiphase flow code TOUGH2 V2. Here we apply TOUGHREACT to one-dimensional modeling of injection into well 34-9RD2. The techniques used can be applied to any injection well of interest. Host rock and fracture mineralogies were taken directly from petrographic studies. Sensitivity studies were performed to examine the effects of changes in pH, temperature, and composition of injection fluid. Both the model and field experience suggest that amorphous silica precipitation is an important factor in the performance of a stimulation experiment. Several methods taken from the literature that attempt to quantify the rates of silica precipitation are compared to those used by",TOUGHREACT.,,INTRODUCTION,"The Coso Geothermal Field is a large, hightemperature system located in California on the western edge of the Basin and Range province (Fig. 1). The system is related to young volcanic activity. The field currently produces 240 MWe. Here we
present petrologic and modeling investigations undertaken as part of a DOE-funded Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) project. The broad objective of this work is to develop an understanding of the geologic setting of the East Flank of Coso, and how it impacts EGS development. Specifically, by gathering petrologic and petrographic data, and incorporating it into a reactive geochemical transport model, the chemical effects of injection can be better understood. Chemical interactions between host rocks and injection fluids can greatly impact the performance of HFR (hot fractured rock) and HDR (hot dry rock) reservoirs over both the short term and long term, by directly affecting porosity and permeability (Durst, 2002 and Bachler, 2003, Xu and Pruess, 2004), but until recently these effects have not been studied. In a nearby Coso well, scale consisting of mostly amorphous silica has been identified (McLin et. al, 2006; Figure 2). In this paper our present model is described, and also the precipitation kinetics of silica polymorphs are discussed.",MODELING APPROACH,"The present simulations were carried out using the non-isothermal reactive geochemical transport code TOUGHREACT (Xu and Pruess, 2001; Xu et al., 2004). This code was developed by introducing reactive chemistry into the framework of the existing multi-phase fluid and heat flow code TOUGH2 V2 (Pruess et al., 1999). More information on TOUGHREACT can be found at the website (http://www-esd.lbl.gov/TOUGHREACT/). Interactions between mineral assemblages and fluids can occur under local equilibrium or kinetic rates. The gas phase can be chemically active. Precipitation and dissolution reactions can change formation porosity and permeability, and can also modify the unsaturated flow properties of the rock. This simulator can be applied to 1-, 2-, and 3-dimensional porous, fractured media with physical and chemical
heterogeneity. It can deal with any number of species present in liquid, solid, and gaseous phases.",SIMULATION SETUP,,Fluid and Heat Flow Conditions,"The geometry and fluid and heat flow conditions are modeled after those described in Xu and Pruess (2004). A one-dimensional MINC (multiple interacting continua) model was used to represent the fractured rock. The MINC method can resolve “global” flow and diffusion of chemicals in the fractured rock and its interaction with “local” exchange between fractures and matrix. Details on
the MINC method for reactive geochemical transport are described by Xu and Pruess (2001). Two different mineral zones are considered: 1) a zone representing the relatively impermeable, unaltered host rock, and 2) a zone representing the relatively fractured, altered veins. Various physical characteristics of the two different zones are shown in Table 1. Density = 2650 kg*m-3, heat capacity = 1000 J*kg-1K-1, and diffusivity = 10-9 m-2s-1 were used for both zones. The cubic law was used to define the porositypermeability relationship in both zones (Xu et al., 2004). The model generates changes in porosity and permeability based on changes in mineral abundances.",Mineralogical Conditions,"The host rock type chosen for the preliminary injection simulations is biotite granodiorite. This rock type dominates the lowest intervals of wells on the 34-9 pad (Figure 3). Granodiorite has also been identified as a major rock type in the zone targeted for stimulation in well 46A-19RD. This is an intermediate rock type in terms of composition and alteration found in the East Flank wells. Estimates of the mineralogical composition of the granodiorite (in terms of volume percentage of solid rock) were made on the basis of x-ray diffraction data and petrographic observations (Kovac et al., 2005; Lutz and Moore, 1997). Mineralogically, the granodiorite consists of mostly quartz, plagioclase, and potassium feldspar with minor biotite (Table 2). In general, the granodiorite displays only weak alteration consisting of illitic clays and chlorite (Table 2). Estimation of the fractured vein mineralogy was made using a more holistic approach based upon the average paragenetic sequence observed in the East Flank wells. Estimates of mineralogical composition in terms of volume percentage of solid rock were based on detailed petrographic observations and petrologic analysis of core and cuttings (Table 2; Kovac et al, 2005; Lutz and Moore, 1997). Porosity and permeability are assumed to be much greater in the fractured vein zone than in the granodiorite zone (Table 1). Initial rock temperature for both zones was
275oC in the preliminary simulations. Conductive heat exchange with the surrounding low-permeability rock is an important process, and is treated with a semi-analytical technique developed by Vinsome and Westerveld (1980).",Mineral Kinetic Rates and Parameters,"Mineral dissolution and precipitation are considered under kinetic constraints. A general kinetic rate expression is used in TOUGHREACT (Xu et al., 2004), or rm= ±kmAmaH+ n |1- Qm/Km| (1)
where m is the mineral index, rm is the dissolution/precipitation rate, (positive for dissolution, negative for precipitation), km is the rate constant (moles per unit mineral surface area and unit time) which is temperature-dependent, Am is the specific reactive surface area per kg of H2O, aH+ is the activity of H+, and n is an empirical reaction order accounting for catalysis by H+ in solution. Km is the equilibrium constant for the mineral-water reaction written for the destruction of one mole of mineral m, Qm is the ion activity product. The temperature dependence of the reaction rate constant can be expressed as: k = k25 exp[ -Ea/R (1/T – 1/298.15)] (2) where Ea is the activation energy, k25 is the rate constant at 25oC, R is the universal gas constant, and T is absolute temperature. Table 3 shows the parameters used in the kinetic rate expression.",Water Chemistry,"The composition of the reservoir fluid was estimated based on the approximate composition taken from an East Flank well (Table 4). Initial fluid compositions within the fractured vein and granodiorite zones were calculated by equilibrating the reservoir fluid composition with each zone’s mineralogical composition at 275oC. An example injection fluid composition that is relatively high in concentrations of Na+, Cl-, and SiO2(aq) was chosen as the trial injection water (Table 4). The injectate composition was not allowed to change over time.",RESULTS,"A one-dimensional MINC (multiple interacting continua) model was used. Our conceptual model considers a one-dimensional flow tube between the injection and production wells, which is a small subvolume of the more extensive three-dimensional
reservoir. The initial reservoir conditions were 275oC temperature and 30MPa pressure. An overpressure of 2MPa was applied to the injection side. The initial simulation was run for a total time of 10 years. Changes in fluid pH, fracture porosity, fracture permeability, fluid temperature, and changes in mineral abundances were monitored out to a distance of 594 m from the injection well. Mineral abundance changes were reported in terms of changes in volume fraction for the following minerals: quartz, potassium feldspar, chlorite, illite, sodium smectite, calcium smectite, calcite, dolomite, anorthite, biotite, amorphous silica, and anhydrite. Calcite, quartz, and amorphous silica displayed the most significant changes. Changes in porosity were calculated as a function of mineral dissolution and precipitation. Porosity increase indicates that mineral dissolution is dominant, while porosity decreases when precipitation dominates. Changes in permeability are calculated from changes in porosity as described above. Figure 4 plots porosity versus distance from the injection well at times 1 day - 10 years after start of injection. Figure 5 displays amorphous silica precipitation versus distance at times 1 day -10 years after initial injection. It is evident that near-wellbore porosity drops 60% shortly after injection (~1 day after injection), due to amorphous silica precipitation. This is in good agreement with field data on amorphous silica precipitation rates (Padilla et al., 2005; Alcober et al., 2005). Figure 6 shows that some quartz precipitation occurs, but that this is several orders of magnitude less significant than the amorphous silica precipitation. Also, the quartz precipitation does not occur as soon as the amorphous silica precipitation. These results are corroborated by field observations (McLin et al., 2006) that identified major amorphous silica and trace quartz in fractures post-injection. Calcite displays a small amount of dissolution near the wellbore (0-0.8m) over the 10 year period (Fig. 7); elsewhere, precipitation is dominant. Further out from the wellbore (~100- 600m), porosity is maintained but has decreased approximately 20% after 10 years. Calcite is the mineral largely responsible for this gradual porosity loss. This is corroborated by observations from the field that calcite dominates the veins further away from the injection wellbore (McLin et al., 2006). Temperature, chemical composition, and pH of injection fluid, host rock and fracture mineralogies can all have great impact on the fate of injection. These parameters will be examined more closely through sensitivity studies in future work. At this point, the relatively large amount of SiO2(aq) in the injection fluid appears to be a factor that could potentially have a significant impact on porosity and permeability.","Geologic, petrographic, temperature, and geochemical data collected on the Coso EGS

Table 8. Summary of quartz precipitation rate estimates using the data for Coso and methodology of the authors listed.
Source Quartz precipitation rates (mol m-2 sec-1) Rimstidt (1980) 2.2E-14 Dove (1994) 3.3E-11 TOUGHREACT 6.2E-14 experiment have been input into TOUGHREACT, creating an initial model of injection into an East Flank well. This model generally agrees with postinjection observations from the field. Significant amorphous silica, and minor amounts of calcite, quartz, and anhydrite are shown to precipitate while only calcite shows dissolution in the fractures. Amorphous silica could reduce porosity and permeability in the vicinity of the injection well during enhancement, and this is corroborated by the initial model. Amorphous silica kinetics, although greatly important to geothermal operations, are considered to be poorly constrained under geothermal conditions. Using the data for Coso, calculations have been made from the literature for the rates of amorphous silica and quartz precipitation and these values have been compared to those used by TOUGHREACT. In the case of quartz, values calculated by TOUGHREACT compare well to values calculated by Rimstidt and Barnes (1980), which follows as the TOUGHREACT method is derived from the Rimstidt and Barnes (1980) method. In the case of amorphous silica, the value calculated by TOUGHREACT is quite different than estimates calculated using Rimstidt and Barnes (1980) and other theoretical methods in the literature. However, it compares well to field and empirical rates from the literature.",T (K) 349.7 349.7,CONCLUSIONS,"Similar calculations were made for quartz, comparing values from the literature to those generated in TOUGHREACT. The kinetics of quartz precipitation are considered to be much more straightforward than those of amorphous silica. Constants for Coso used to make these calculations are shown in Table 7. The method of Rimstidt and Barnes (1980) as described above was used to generate an approximate precipitation rate of quartz of 2.2E-14 mol*m-2*sec1. Dove (1994) uses a different approach to the problem. Here, the rate equation is based on a surface reaction model that relates changes in modeled surface complexes with quartz reactivity in aqueous solutions (Dove, 1994). According to Dove’s equation the precipitation rate can be found from the relation: rate = exp-10.7T exp(-66000/RT)(θ>SiOH
) + exp4.7T exp(-82700/RT)(θ>SiO - tot
)1. (9) Using this method, the rate of quartz precipitation is 3.3E-11 mol*m-2*sec-1. The rate expression for quartz in TOUGHREACT is given in Eq. 1. Thus, it follows that the value calculated by TOUGHREACT is very similar to that of Rimstidt and Barnes (Table 8). These two values are significantly different that that of Dove (1994), which seems reasonable considering the approach is quite different.",QUARTZ PRECIPITATION KINETICS,"silica concentration, temperature, pH, and salinity. Table 5 shows input parameters from the East Flank used in making all calculations except Weres et al. (1982). Using Weres et al. (1982) graphical method (Figure 1 and Equations (9) and (10) in their paper), the rate of amorphous silica deposition was calculated at a pH = 7 to be 2.8E-7 mol*m-2*sec-1, and at the pH of injection (~5) to be 5.6E-9 mol*m2*sec-1. Therefore, under acid conditions, the rate of deposition decreases by two orders of magnitude compared to neutral conditions. Carroll et al. (1998) investigated amorphous silica precipitation under simple laboratory conditions, which was found to follow the equation: Rateppt = kppt exp (-Ea/RT) (1- exp(∆Gr/RT)) (3) and more complicated field observations, which followed the relationships Rateppt = 10
-10.00±0.06 (exp ∆Gr/RT)4.4±0.3 (4), or Rateppt = 10
-9.29±0.03 (∆Gr/RT)1.7±0.1 (5). Using the values for Coso yielded rates of 2.6E-11 [Si]m-2sec-1 for the laboratory relationship and 3.1E-8 and 8.1E-10 for the field relationships. The field results are larger than the laboratory results. The authors attributed the difference in values to differing controls on laboratory setup versus field conditions. The dominant precipitation mechanism would be elementary reaction control in the laboratory, while in the more complicated field experiments it would be surface defect/nucleation control (Carroll et. al 1998). Rimstidt and Barnes (1980) use a method based on transition state theory that is consistent with a thermodynamic approach. This approach is largely the one reactive geochemical programs are based upon, including TOUGHREACT. Using the equations of Rimstidt and Barnes a deposition rate of 1.5E-11 mol*m-2*sec-1 is obtained. Using the equations employed in TOUGHREACT for amorphous silica precipitation (Xu et al., 2004): r = kA[Ωθ-1/(Ω2θ)] (6), where k= k25 exp[-Ea/R* (1/T- 1/298.15)] (7), and Ω = Q/K (8).
This method yields a rate of 6.5E-7 mol*m-2*sec-1. In looking at the summary of all calculations (Table 6), it is apparent that the calculations made by TOUGHREACT compare well in general to field and empirical rates from the literature, and less well to the theoretical models.",T (K) 349.7 349.7 349.7,"Both the model and field experience suggest that under the conditions proposed for the hydrofracture experiment and injection, amorphous silica precipitation could be problematic. Amorphous silica is the mineral expected to precipitate most strongly near the injection well and therefore have the greatest impact on near-wellbore porosity and permeability. Several methods have been proposed in the literature
to quantify rates of amorphous silica precipitation. Here calculations are made using the data for Coso that compare these methods to those used by TOUGHREACT. Similar calculations are also made for quartz, although the kinetics are considered to be much more straightforward for quartz than for amorphous silica. Amorphous silica precipitation kinetics are complicated and considered to be poorly constrained.
It can precipitate through two different mechanisms: 1) molecular deposition and 2) colloidal deposition. Molecular deposition occurs when monomeric silica precipitates directly onto a solid silica surface. Colloidal deposition occurs when the solution is oversaturated in silica by a factor of ten or greater. In this case, the silica molecules polymerize and form a colloid that remains suspended in the fluid. After the colloidal particles reach a critical size, they then begin to precipitate. Weres et al. (1982) developed a method for calculating molecular silica deposition.

3. SUBSIDENCE OF THE WILMINGTON OIL FIELD, CALIFORNIA
hitroduction. Over a large portion of the Los Angeles coastal plain a slow surface subsidence has been going on for several decades (Nicholson, 1929; Grant and Sheppard, 1939; Grant, 1944; (lilluly and Grant, esp. pp. 463-482, 1949). This widespread subsi<lence has amounted to a few tenths of a foot. It may have been caused entirely by reduction in artesian water pressure due to excessive well pumping from relatively superficial aquifers, but possibly part of it was caused by depletion of reservoir pressure in early oil fields. In addition to tliis widespread and relatively slight subsidence, several areas of accentuated subsidence are located in oil fields within the coastal plain. Repeated spirit-level surveys by a number of agencies demonstrate that accentuated subsidence has taken place over the Playa del Key. Inglewood, Torrance, Santa Fe Springs, Huntington Beach, Long Beach, and Wilmington oil fields. At the present time the maximum subsidence in the Wilmington field has amounted to more than 18 feet (fig. 1).
Initialion of Subsidence in the Wilmington Field. Shortly after significant oil production from the Wilmington field began in 1937, accelerated subsidence of bench marks within the field was noted. Repeated spirit-leveling soon permitted the drawing of isobases (isopleths) of subsidence (flg. 1), which demonstrated that the rapidly sinking area was roughly elliptical in outline, with the major axis of the ellipse approximately congruent with the axis of the elongate domal structure of the oil field. Surface subsidence has progressed continuously witli oil production, and the subsiding area covers and extends a little beyond the producing area of the field.
Cause of the Suhsidence. An analysis of all possible causes of the subsidence has been recently publislicd (Ciillnly and Grant, 1949). and only a consideration of the now generally accepted cause need be included here; namely, compression of .sediments due to decrease in hydrostatic pressure in the interstitial fluids of the oil zones. When exploitation of the field began, each oil zone had a reservoir pressure approximately equal to the hydrostatic pressure that would be produced by a column of water cxteiuling from the zone to the surface. This fluid pressure supported part of the ilownward thrust occasioned by the total bulk weight of the overburden of sediments. WHien oil extraction reduced tlie fluid pressure, a greater part of the overburden weight was imposed on the granular fabric of the solid part of the oil zone, compressing it vertically. Tliis compression is

aceompli.shed in two ways: (1) by rearraiig<Miient of discrete grains of the sediment and concomitant squeezing of clayey, limy, or ferruginous cement from points of potential contact ijctween grains to stress shadows in the interstitial voids, and (2) by elastic distortion of the grains themselves. The first i)lienomenon is essentially irreversible, whereas the second is reversible in part.
Elastic fatigue, flow .slips in crystal grains, and reduction in flexural rigidity of the deformctl overlying strata through plastic flow and .shear rupture, all tend to prevent complete clastic recovery wlien and if fluid pressures are restored to their original values. Tlie elastic distortion of individual grains is believed to cause but slight change in volume of each grain, although the amount of grain volume change is dependent upon several factors, such as number and effectiveness of constraints to expansion, and Pois.son 's ratio of the grain material. Therefore artificial rcpressuring of the oil zones, il' done as a corrective measure, can be depended upon to dclaj- or to retard future subsidence, but not to restore completely the original elevations of points on tlie subsided surface.
Iloritoiddl Disphici incuts Dm lo Subsidence. A study of the physical facts of the subsidence indicates tliat the Terminal zone (Upper and Lower Terminal zones combined) has made the greatest contribution to the subsidence, the contributions of the lower zones being additive to that produced by the greater vertical shortening in the Terminal zone above. The depth to the top of the Terminal zone averages about 3,000 feet or a little more, and hence the overlying sediments can be conveniently compared to a plate or prism, 3,000 feet thick, that is deformed by its own body force (gravity) acting on a failing foundation below. An analogue that permits a relatively simple mathematical analysis consists of a plate resting on a vast stratum of coil springs, tlie subsidence being produced by a central point load or by a uniformly distributed loail. It can be seen intuitively that the reaction of the compressed coil springs is unlike that due to vertical pressure e.xcrted on an elastically isotropic contiiuiuiii. ill the latter case, the horizontal expansion of each column of foundation as it is vertically compressed—the Poi.sson ""bulge"" influences contiguous volumes of foundation material, and so on.
This i)crmits an analogy with the dcHections of a circular or elliptical plate, damped at the margins and deformed by a surface load. The analogy requires certain assumptions if the mathematical treatment is to be kept relatively simple. The clamped plate margin is a simplifying subterfuge to pnidin'c an iii(lecli<in in the subsidence

If we confine our interest, at least initially, to the plate within the inflection line, this clamped subterfuge is a very convenieut simplification, and serves to explain the nature or the mechanics of some of the phenomena encountered in the oil field.
The assumption that the plate (prism of sediments overlying' the Terminal zone in the prototype) is. homogeneous and elastically i.sotropie, and that the constraint against horizontal deflection oil the lower surface (where, in the prototype, the overburden rests on the top of the Terminal zone) does not significantly destroy the phenomenon of pure bending, does permit the use of some simple equations developed in the theory of elasticity to explain many of the known facts in the oil field. As the vertical deflection is very small with respect to the lateral extent of the plate, it is reasonable to assume that stress values tangential to isopleths of vei'tical deflection are so small compared to radial stress values that they can be ignored. This permits the use of the analogue of a horizontal beam of uniform rectangular cross section with built-in ends deformed by a point load or a uniformly distributed load. We can assume that the analogue beam has unit thickness and a depth of section equal to the thickness of the overburden of sediments resting on the Terminal zone. This hypothetical beam is oriented acro.ss a diameter of an assumed circular subsidence or, in the more realistic case of an elliptical sidisidcuce, along a line orthogonal to the isobases of sid)sidenee. Torsional stresses must be ignored (Grant 1954).
With the adoption of these assumptions, we can see from figure 2 that horizontal disijlacements result from rotation of imaginary planes cutting the long axis of the beams. We can further see that rotation is greatest at the inflection point in the deformation curve. and that no rotation and hence no horizontal displacement occurs at the center of the depression nor at the clamped terminal ends. The equation for the deflection curve of such a chuupi'd beam deformed by a uniformly distributed load is

.\t thr iiiflc'ction point, where the central concave surface curve iiicigcs into the marginal convex curve, the subsidence .slope is greatest and the rotation of verti<-al planes is likewise greatest. Hence, in the prototype, surface points at the inflection line should show the greatest horizontal displacement. Field surveys indicate this to be true. Some survey stations near the inflection line have been displaced more than G feet toward the center of the subsided area (fig. 1). It can be readily seen that the amount of horizontal displacement, u, is a function of the magnitude of the rotation angk- fl, and of h, the half-depth of the beam (or prism of sediments). Thus,
u = f (i9, h). Because 8 is very small, sine 8 is aiqiroximately e(|ual to tangent 6,
and we obtain the relation : u = h tan 0.
It must be recognized tliat the simplifying assumptions re.sorted to above prevent a rigorous analysis, but we can nevertheless apply this simple mechani.sm and technique to conipiilc ihe approximate horizontal displacements of surface points if the rotation angle and the thickness of the deformed overburden are known. The rotation angle, 6. is nearly eipial to the slope created by subsidence if we neglect the effect of the bottom surface constraint. The slope angle can be readily determiiu'il from data on the subsidence majis.
Because the artificiality of an analogue plate or beam with chim])ed ends destroys the values and distribution of stresses from the inflection point to the damped margins, it is desirable to eliminate this clamping subterfuge.

lpng:th rostinj; on an elastic fonndation and defoi-nied by a point load. Tliis analogue has the fni'ther advantage that it explains the occasional slight uplifts around the margins of the subsiding area. These ei)hemeral uplifts have been detected in the Wilmington field by repeated spirit leveling. Unfortunately, an adequate mathematical discussion of the deformation of the infinite beam is too lengthy to be included here, but derivations and solutions of the fundamental equations can be obtained from available literature (for example, von Karman and Biot, 1940; Pipes, 1946). The surface curve of such a beam is characterized by a prominent central depression that is bounded outwardly by a small elevation, beyond which are die-away waves somewhat like damped sine curves that become asymptotic to the line of zero ordinate. A marginal annular uplift occasionally detected in the Wilmington field, and also noted in another oil field studied by the author, is likely to be nearly or entirely obliterated periodically by a decrease in flexural rigidity of the deformed strata through shear ruptures, plastic flow, or clastic fatigue.
Stihsurface Shear Ruptures. In 1947 a number of oil wells in the Wilmington field were seriously damaged by horizontal shear stresses at depths of about 1,500 to 1,600 feet. These damaged wells are on the strongly flexed south flank of the subsidence iu a reniform area bisected by the inflection line. The subsidence slope, and hence the rotation angle of the bent overburden, was greatest in this area. As rotation angles increased with the progress of differential subsidence,
several later episodes of subsurface shear damage to wells occurred. Finally, in an area along the inflection line on the north flank of the subsidence, where rotation angles reached critical values at a later date, considerable subsurface shear damage took place. The comparison of shear stresses in deformed beams of uniform cross section provides a crude analogue to the oil field prototype. It can be shown by a mathematical demonstration that, when reasonable .simplifying assumptions arc made, the axially directed shear stresses

in deformed beams are greatest at the inflection points and in the neutral plane of the beam. The neutral plane is midway of the vertical dimensions of the beam. In rock strata, which have less
strength in tension than in compression, the neutral plane tends to
migrate toward the concave surface during strong bending. The sheared wells were centered about the inflection line, and the shearing damage occurred at points about half way from the surface to the top of the Terminal zone.
It is of interest to note that local earthquakes were cavised by some
of the sudden shear slips (fault movements) in the Wilmington field.
Sheur'nuj lU.sisftnicc tniil Dratj at Base of Overburden. The plate
or prism of sedimentary overburden resting on the top of the Ter-
minal oil zone rotates during the bending (folding) that accompanies
dift'erential subsidence. Pure and simple bending is jirevented by a
constraint against horizontal slipping between the bottom of the
overburden plate and the top of the underlying Ternnnal zone. This
is due to the shearing resistance at the contact. Shearing resistance,
Sr, can be expressed by the following modification of Coloumb's
equation : SR = C-f (P,— Pu) tan.^. where C is cohesion, Pt is normal pressure at the zone of potential rupture due to the total weight of the overburden. P„ is ])ore-water
pressure or hydrostatic pressure in the interstitial fluids, and (j> is the
angle of internal friction of the .sedimentary material. Cohesion in
uncemented sands normally is lower than in shales, some of which in
the Wilmington field are moderately cemented. However, the angle of internal friction in the sands is likely to be nmch higher than in the shales. The value of <j> iu sands is likely to lie between :iO^ and 45°, w'hereas in shales the value generally lies between Vl' and :iO°.
Therefore the resisting shear is likely to be significantly less in the
shales than in the sands, and consequently a nipture with horizontal
displacement is more expectable iu the shales .iust above the sandy oil beds than iu the oil sands themselves.
A glance at the shearing-resistance e(|uation indicates that a reduction in fluid pressure (P„) greatly iiu'reases resisting shear, and it is obvious lli;it nil production reduces reservoir pressure much more rapidly in llii' priiduciiig sands than in the relalivel.v im-

In this situation cohesion and the coefficient of internal friction (tan <f>) attain zero values, and a shear rupture and displacement may occur at or near the top of the producing sands. This has been noted by the author in another subsided oil field, where much sand has accompanied the oil during production. In the Wilmington field little sand is produced -with the oil, and no actual rupture at the top of the Terminal zone has yet been noted. This particular horizon, however, must be a locus of above-average intensity of shear stress, and a future rupture may occur there if bending of the overburden becomes more severe.
Compression and Tension at the Surface. An inspection of figure 2 demonstrates that radial compression at the surface must result from rotations within the inflection lines, and that radial tension at the surface must occur in an annular area outside the inflection lines. This must follow if the kinematics of deformation of the prototype are like those of the analogue. That the strains in the analogue are representative of those in the prototype is borne out by the buckling of railroad tracks and compression rupture of rigid structures in the central area of subsidence, and by the tension rupture of radially directed linear structures in the outer marginal zone. These strains and failures in the oil field have been very costly.
Vertical Tension in the Center of Subsidence. In 1952 the author 's attention was called to what appeared to be tension damage to oil well casings within the overburden sediments in the central portion of the subsidence. In this central area the upper half of the sediments overlying the Terminal zone is subjected to strong radial compression due to centripetal movements of surface points. This horizontal compres.sion must result in a tendency toward vertical expansion, and, as there is not room for much expansion downward, the surface must undergo a relative vertical uplift. This rising of the surface in the central area must be relative and not absolute, as the rate of subsidence tliere is about 2 feet per year.
Repeated spirit leveling has brought to light a pulsating rate of subsidence, and when the interval between surveys is very short (two weeks) occasional small uplifts have been detected. This phenomenon may be due to irregular periodic upward expansions. The amount of this vertical expansion must be a function of the magnitude of the compressive stresses, the volume of compressed sediments, and the value of Poisson's ratio. This value must be somewhat between zero and one half. We are assuming here that the phenomenon is an elastic one, though unquestionably a part of it must be of a plastic type. Regardless of the relative roles of elasticity and plasticity, the vertical expansion at times has been sufficient to cause tension failures in oil wells.
Threshold Value of Vertical Actress Causing Surface Subsidence. Some oil fields that have been producing for many years either do not seem to have suffered much surface subsidence, or for some reason their subsidence has not become generally known. The compression of aquifers accompanying relativel.v moderate i)ressure drops IS well known, and it seems rea.sonable to suppose that reduction in reservoir pressure in all oil fields producing frotn interstitial voids in granular media must cause some subsidence of the surface. This ilifference in the magnitude of surface subsidence in oil fiekls can be due to several factors, of which some are quite obvious and others are obscure. For example, when a thick prism of overburden sediments of high fiexural rigidity overlies a localized region of reservoir-pressure drop, the surface subsidence may be inconsequciital. In other areas the supporting-arch effect of an anticlinal strvictnre may minimize surface subsidence. A less obvious factor in minimizing surface subsidence of a producing field is involved in the geologic history of the area. Unconformities in the overburden may represent removal of former thicknesses of sediment whose great weight at one time so compressed the producing zones that additional compression of significant amount cannot be attained even by a reduction of inter.stilial fluid ])ressure to atmospheric pressure. Or a threshold value of overburden weight, established by the great sediment thickness that at one time overlay the oil zone, may result in insignificant subsidence during the early producing history of the field—this early slight subsidence being due to elastic strain in the producing zone—whereas later on a critical value of compression is attained and pronounced subsidence occurs. This acceleration of subsidence begins at a definite reduced value of reservoir pressure. Thus a sudden increa.se in subsidence rate without a parallel sudden decrease in reservoir pressure (due say, to stepped-up ])roduction) may lead to detection of obscure disconformities in the overlying sedimentary cover.
24 ENGINEERING ASPECTS OF GEOLOGY [Bull. 170
It is obvious that subsidence assists oil recovery by tending to maintain reservoir pressure. During subsidence the potential energy of the overlying prism is converted in part into reservoir energy.

Two major anomalies were identified in the survey area. A negative 108-mV anomaly in the North (HMS-A) and a negative 96-mV anomaly in the South (HMS-B), both of which appear to be electro-kinetically produced anomalies. The anomalies are generally coincident with the higher shallow temperature gradients. The radial nature of the South anomaly suggests a flow of thermal fluids structurally controlled by faults analogous to regional patterns. Two target areas were identified and the drilling of two deeper test holes (programmed to 3,000 feet) is to be completed in mid-2011.",Introduction,"The US Navy’s Geothermal Program Office (GPO), has continued its geothermal exploration in the Chocolate Mountains Aerial Gunnery Range (CMAGR) with a focus on the Camp Billy Machen training area, extending generally northeast of Niland, California to east of the Hot Mineral Spa Known Geothermal Resources Area (HMSpa) (Figure 1). The CMAGR is a military air and ground training range situated along the eastern margin of the Salton Sea in southern California. The range is managed by the
Marine Corps Air Station, Yuma, AZ. The US Navy Geothermal Program Office (GPO) has conducted exploration activities within CMAGR a various times beginning in 1976 (Alm et al, 2010). Current exploration program begin in 2008 following the issuance of a directive from the Commandant, United States Marine Corps, in support of the development of geothermal resources on Marine Corps installations.
The prospect area is located along the far eastern margin of the Salton Trough where a thick section of Quaternary alluvium slopes gently westward from the Chocolate Mountains. Away from the mountainside, the alluvium overlies Lake Cahuilla and associated late-Holocene/Pleistocene sediments (Figure 2, overleaf). The mountains themselves are here composed primarily of Tertiary intrusive, hypabyssal rocks - multiple parallel dikes of porphyritic quartz latite composition injected in fine-grained porphyritic quartz monzonite of possibly pre-Tertiary age. The abundance and regularity of the dikes gives the appearance of well-layered rock. Isolated occurrences of Tertiary volcanics (rhyodacitic to rhyolitic plug domes, lava flows) are present as well. Underlying
these Tertiary units is a Precambrian igneous and metamorphic rock complex (also mapped as the Chuckwalla Complex) of quartz diorite gneiss, foliated hybrid granitic rocks, and granophyres, largely acidic to intermediate range in composition. Except for reconnaissance geologic mapping and a LiDAR survey, all of the prospecting has been focused on the alluvial slope.
Beginning in the summer of 2008 gravity and magnetic data were acquired over the prospect. Apparent buried basement fault structures were mapped and interpreted through both density and magnetic contrasts (Figure 3). In the exposed bedrock, major structures trend northwest (N35W to N55W) in the Tertiary outcrop, generally parallel to the San Andreas fault zone. In the prospect area, this anticipated major NW structural trend appears disturbed (cross-cut) by numerous N, NE, and almost east-west structures. These apparent structural trends appear to be generally consistent with trends both to the northeast in the mountains, as well as, in the subsurface to the south within Ormat NV’s Wister
project (Skip Matlick, personal communication). These appear to represent to reflect the local structural pattern associated with the San Andreas fault System. These include NW-trending structures generally parallel to the San Andreas, as well as NNE and NE orientations which may be directly related to tensional and reidel structures extending outward along the northeastern edge of this fault system.
High resolution LiDAR (light detection and ranging) data were also acquired in 2008 over the CMAGR exploration areas to produce artificially illuminated hillshades and slope intensity maps used to identify subtle linear features, i.e. faults scarps, faceted hillsides, vegetation lineaments, and low relief slope inflections. Active or young structures within this western piedmont of the Chocolate Mountains are likely conduits for potential hydrothermal fluids near the surface. Several sets of geomorphic lineaments were identified based on alignments of slope breaks, drainage deflections, drainage confluences, and gravel bar terminations, however all were determined to be of a non-tectonic nature except one. This is a northwest striking, southwest dipping, 40 centimeter high structure that has 0.5 kilometer of well-defined surface expression and was roughly traced out in both directions for a total of ~6.5 kilometers – providing another potential geothermal target.",Shallow TGH Drilling Results,"As previously reported (Alm et al, 2010), results of the above investigations were integrated and several target sites were defined for shallow temperature gradient drilling. This effort, consisting of a total of 13, 500-foot deep, test holes was completed in 2010, with temperature gradients ranging from 5.3 to 23.5 degrees F/100 feet (Figure 3). Test hole construction consisted two stages: 1) drilling a nominal 12-inch hole, setting and cementing in eightinch diameter, 50-foot steel surface conductor; and 2) drilling a six-inch open-hole to 500 feet and completing with sealed 3-inch internal diameter coupled PVC pipe, bentonite and gravel-packed. The PVC is filled with fresh water and a locking cap installed on the surface conductor pipe. Chip samples were taken at 10-foot
intervals and logged. Equilibrated temperature logs were run between 60 and 90 days following completion of each test hole.
A distinct areal distribution of shallow temperature gradient can be seen, with all test hole gradients above 8.8 degrees F/100 feet occurring in the northwest part of the prospect implying a significantly higher potential for the occurrence of a geothermal resource in the northwest. However, a part of the probable explanation for this can be seen in Figure 4, a generalized NW-SE cross-section through the prospect. All of the test holes with gradients less than 8.8 intersected mostly or entirely Pleistocene Lake Cahuilla and associated sediments – dominantly impermeable clays and muds, while the other holes intersected thick sections of highly permeable alluvial slope wash – sands, gravels and cobbles. In the southeastern area, even if open basement fractures are present and are conductive to deeper hot fluids, their thermal signature may be masked by the thick section of shallow clays.
Figure 3. Temperature gradient drilling results over detailed prospect gravity map.
Figure 5 shows the temperature profiles for all of the test holes. Most of the lower gradient profiles are clearly conductive. Projecting these conductive gradients to depth, temperatures in the range of 150o to 160oF would not be seen above about 1500 to 2000 feet and the area would not appear prospective. This is a good example of why temperature gradient drilling must be viewed in context with other geological and geophysical data.",Self Potential Surveys,"Self-potential (SP) methods measure naturally occurring electrical potential in the earth. One source of these naturally occurring self-potentials is the “streaming potential” or electrokinetic potential which arises from the flow of fluid, such as groundwater,
and Hoover, 1979) result of ion rich fluid transportation and electrical voltages produced from temperature differences. This method has been described as very successful in identifying shallow zones of upwelling geothermal fluids at a number of known geothermal resource areas such as; LongValley, California (Anderson and Johnson, 1976), Cerro Prieto, Mexico (Goldstein et al., 1989), East Mesa (Goldstein et al., 1989), Beowawe (Demoully and Corwin, 1980), and Newcastle (Ross et al., 1990).
Therefore, the SP method was chosen as a least cost way to potentially differentiate outflow from HMSpa versus fault-controlled upwelling beneath the TGH’s. Elevated Temperatures in TGH-7, 9, 12, and ALT-3 along with known production of geothermal fluids for direct use at several nearby resorts and aquaculture developments inspired the initial survey location and design over this portion of the prospect area. Two detailed SP surveys were conducted in the Camp Billy Machen/Hot Mineral Spa region of the CMAGR in November and December 2010 (Surveys 1 and 2). The first was designed to gather detail SP resistivity data in the region of those temperature gradient test holes with the highest gradients. The second survey was designed to augment and confirms the results of the first (Figure 6).",SP Method,"All data were collected by two four-person survey crews. Each three or four-person crew consisted of one or two people laying out the survey lines and two people collecting the self-potential
(SP) data. The November survey design was based on the “radial spoke” technique, which typically consists of lines being laid out in a radial pattern originating from a central stationary electrode or “base station.” A similar method was applied to the second survey, however the layout of the lines was done in a more grid (90o) pattern. Stationary electrode type surveys with a single roving electrode, compared to leap-frog type surveys where there is no stationary electrodes, minimize cumulative errors that can result from intersecting profiles. In an effort to greatly reduce the potential for compound polarization and drift error, all new base stations were referenced back to the original or primary base station, plus the natural voltage between pots was monitored in an electrolyte bath before and after each survey leg. The temperature of the porous pots was regulated to the extent possible by keeping them shaded because temperature differences between pots can cause a significant amount of drift as well.
Line stations were marked at a 200-foot spacing using a Trimble Juneau SB handheld that operates at ~3-meter accuracy. Lines were designed in the field using the ESRI Arcpad program installed on the Trimble unit and spacing was determined using a 200-foot length of wire. The team operating the GPS unit would clear a small 4-6” wide depression of debris, add about a cup of water, take a GPS measurement, name the site, and then flag for ease of location by the SP team. Allowing one group to work ahead gave the water in the electrode holes time to allow the infiltration potential to completely decay and still provide enhanced electrical contact with the soil. It was observed by Ross (2009) that in a similar arid environment initial infiltration potentials after watering produced +30mV and then decreased to 0-5mV after a period of 10-30 minutes. Our survey was designed to allow for a period of 1-3 hours before an electrode measurement was ever taken. The voltage reading was often retested to verify that the reading was not still being affected by the infiltration potentials.
The survey lines were almost exclusively “cross-country” type traverses since our survey procedure equated to little more than hiking with geophysical equipment across the ranges. Survey lines were laid out by GIS technicians from ESS and a reasonable amount of flagging was used to mark the shortest path along the line as needed. In several instances large drainages were crossed and older alluvial terraces, incised as much as 15 feet, had to be ascended and descended with regularity. This rapid, local change in elevation is considered to be a potential source of error in the data since uneven topography may affect surface potential fields by distorting current flow patterns (Corwin, 1979).
Select data was processed in the field by doing a simplified base correction or tie-in calculation to allow for diligent survey expansion design on the fly. Every evening all data was processed in an Excel spreadsheet so that long integer calculations, which help reduce compound errors, could be swiftly completed with ease and the next day’s survey could be designed to effectively map and define anomalies. Upon completion of the survey all data was reviewed for accuracy before being contoured in ArcMap 3D Analyst (Figure 6). Contouring was examined in detail to further delineate potential issues or concentrations of noisy/ inaccurate/misplaced data. From this visual inspection several corrections were made, several areas with increased noise were left to source speculation, and one survey line was omitted entirely.",SP Survey Interpretation,"Four features in the Camp Billy Machen/Hot Mineral Spa SP survey area have compelling amplitude, extent, and orientation to be considered anomalies worthy of further testing. These are discussed below.
HMS-A. This anomaly occurs in the far NW portion of the survey, SW of the Salt Creek Wash. HMS-A trends NNW ~6000 feet along its long axis and ranges from -54 to -100mV with the heart of the anomaly approximately 2000 feet NW of TGH-12 (Figure 6). This dipolar self-potential anomaly has a 140mV peak to trough amplitude and 3000 feet peak to trough length. This high amplitude portion of the anomaly is about 1700 feet across on the short axis and has a similar range of -55 to -100 mV. The anomaly, as defined by Survey 1, had the potential to be a continuation of negative values cumulated in the reference base correction and was therefore heavily targeted for follow-up work in Survey 2. In Survey 2 five survey lines were run perpendicular to the long axis trend of the anomaly from new base stations. Three survey lines filled areas with little data and two survey lines were laid very close to existing lines to test the repeatability of the data. The results were very encouraging. The fill-in lines did little to
Figure 7. Section A-A’ across anomalies HMS-A and HMS-C.
alter the contouring of the general shape of the defined anomaly and the parallel lines reproduced the data mostly within 1-10mV with a maximum difference of 20mV.
Potential survey noise can be generated from several sources and could have caused some of the minor issues in accurately reproducing the data. These include:
a) infiltration potentials that did not fully decay before readings were taken;
b) minor amount of rain occurred during the night before the first day of Survey 2. The rain could have concentrated groundwater flow across certain areas and created electrokinetic voltage, potentially altering the field; and
c) the variability in the short distance between the two lines could be valid, giving strength to the argument that when testing data reproducibility one should reoccupy the actual stations in order to create an accurate comparison.
Anomaly HMS-A appears to have a high potential for being real. The combined data strongly suggests that it probably arises from a natural source, potentially a upwelling of geothermal fluids. We have closure on all sides and were able to reproduce the data with a good deal of confidence, suggesting that this anomaly is distinct from the HMSpa…and that our field methods were thorough and well executed by all team members.
HMS-B. This broad anomaly occurs in the SE portion of the survey area with lows in the range of -40 to -87 mV along a 7500 feet NNW trending profile. HMS-B is well-defined with over 20 survey lines from 5 different base stations recorded over both phases of the survey (Figure 9). There is also an antithetic spur that trends off the southern section of the profile to the NE with negative values of -53 and -68. Although the anomaly has a well defined general trend the overall data has a noisy character to it. This causes some irregularity in the contouring that is difficult to account for.
Potential noise issues could be very similar to the ones mentioned in regards to HMS-A or the effects of uneven topography on electrical current flows patterns described by Corwin (1979).
Figure 10 attempts to display relationships between uneven topography and data noise, showing survey profiles that represent the long axis of the anomaly in a side by side comparison with an elevation profile from our LiDAR dataset. The presence of a relationship between elevation irregularity and SP data noise is very difficult to discern at this scale since the resolution of the two data sets is very different. However it displays very well that the SP data in the NW is grouped much more tightly than that in SE. This seems to generally correlate with a much smoother elevation profile in the NW and a much more uneven profile to SE, again where we generally start to see an increase in the variability of the SP data or what could be interpreted as noise.
Similar to HMS-A, HMS-B should be considered to have a high potential for being associated with a natural SP source such as upwelling geothermal fluids. Even though there appears to be some significant noise associated with the data and the contouring is slightly irregular the dominant trend of the anomaly appears to align with the trend of HMS-A and regional structural patterns. Matched with encouraging thermal anomalies from nearby temperature gradient holes and similar patterning found in the magnetics and gravity interpretations make this anomaly a high priority for future exploration.
HMS-C. This is a very small smoothly contoured anomaly located 1000 feet from the southern tip of HMS-A. It has a circular contour pattern about 500 feet across with minimum values of -48, -76, and -88 mV (Figure 6). Several lines from various base stations in both phases of the survey were measured across this anomaly to fully delineate a potential source.
SP values rapidly increase in every direction as you move away from this minor anomaly. This is likely a continuation of HMS-A. A steep, well incised drainage in the range front may potentially be funneling ground water across and masking what would otherwise be a larger more continuous HMS-A. This would be a good target for further testing with lower cost surveys before attempting a deep borehole in the HMS-A/C area. 2-meter temperature probes could be an excellent way to see if there are elevated temperatures near the surface and how they compare with readings over nearby SP and thermal anomalies.
HMS-D. This anomaly appears to be a northwestward continuation of HMS-B and is separated by a broad zone of moderately low values in the range of -10 to -40 mV (Figure 6). The values across HMS-D range from -20 to -60 mV over 8500 feet. One of Figure 9. SP anomaly HMS-B.
the major issues with this minor anomaly is the survey coverage. We acquired only a small amount of data perpendicular to what appears to be the general trend of the anomaly. This was a section of the survey area where there was little room between the range front and the Coachella Canal. The canal is another possible noise source for the entire dataset since one of the primary applications of SP surveying is the identification of subsurface leaks in the dams and canal liners. The base stations were therefore kept at least 500 feet from the canal whenever possible and it was observed that data became more positive as survey lines approached the canal. It was for that reason data acquisition in this area was kept to minimum. However, looking back, a few short lines perpendicular to the regional trend would have been very useful to better define the extent and character of the anomaly.
The extent and potential source of this anomaly is very uncertain. Acquisition of additional SP data points along short lines perpendicular to the primary line may help define the true shape of the anomaly. Drilling a grid of 2-meter temperature probes across the anomaly may also be useful in defining the relationship between the SP anomaly, the high temperature gradient test hole, TGH-ALT3, and the nearby thermal features of the HMSpa KGRA.",Discussion and Conclusions,"Integration and interpretation of several geological and geophysical data sets resulted in the targeting of 13, 500-foot deep temperature gradient test holes, drilled in a general southeast to northwest pattern through the Camp Billy Machen/Hot Mineral Spa prospect area. Chip samples revealed dominantly Pleistocene Lake Cahuilla sediments in the southern section and Quaternary alluvial slope wash sediments in the northern section. Equilibrated temperature logs were run between 60 and 90 days following completion of each test hole with resulting temperature gradients ranging from 5.3 to 23.5 degrees F/100 feet.
Self-potential surveys were designed to further investigate the northern portion of the prospect area. These identified several broad, high-amplitude SP anomalies coincident with the 500-foot thermal anomalies. These appear to be worthy of further exploration. These SP anomalies share several general characteristics. Their amplitudes generally range from -40 to -100mV and this range is well beyond that which could be associated with potential noise sources combined with the local background potentials. They are well defined on all sides with the exception of HMS-D, which is recognized to require further work to verify. Anomalies HMS-A and –B, especially, were both extensively verified with cross-cutting lines in Survey 2 in order to verify the reproducibility of the data from Survey 1.
Most importantly, the anomalies tend to share an elongated 2-dimensional shape which appear to reflect the local structural pattern associated with the San Andreas fault System. These include NW-trending structures generally parallel to the San Andreas, as well as orientations which may be directly related to tensional and reidel structures extending outward along the northeastern edge of this fault system. Whether this pattern actually reflects deep-seated permeable faults providing conduits for upwelling geothermal fluids directly beneath these SP anomalies
or whether they simply provide relatively shallow conduits for the lateral distribution of geothermal fluids feeding the HMSpa area remains to be determined. This step is now being taken.
Based on the assemblage and interpretation of these results along with those of our earlier work, two potential deep target areas were identified, HMS-A and HMS-B. Of these, HMS-B has been selected for the drilling of two deeper test holes (programmed to 3,000 feet) (Figure 11). It is anticipated that these holes will be completed by the third quarter, 2011. Key elements to this work will be the acquisition of geophysical logs over the entire length of the drill holes, including acoustic and/or resistivity imaging logs. These should allow for three-dimensional mapping of fractures and faults, as well as the calculation of the active tectonic stress regime at this prospect",Acknowledgements,"We appreciate the continued support for this exploration effort on the part of both the United States Marine Corps at Marine Corps Air Station, Yuma, AZ and the United States Naval Special Forces at Camp Billy Machen, Niland, CA.

1. ABSTRACT
All of the brine and condensate produced in the Bulalo geothermal field has been injected since 1979, when the first two 55 power plants came on-line. However, in 1989 the return of the cool injectate to the reservoir caused well productivity declines in the western part of the field. Between 1989 and early 1992, injection wells were drilled from production wells to mitigate this problem. Numerical reservoir validated this development strategy, and well productivity improved rapidly after injection was moved. Based on the predicted field performance, acceleration of production through capacity additions was shown to be feasible. In 1994, binary units comprising i6 were installed, utilizing waste brine that was previously injected directly to the reservoir. Modular units consisting of 40 baseload capacity and 40 W e standby capacity will begin operation in 1995-96. After the planned additions, installed capacity will be 426 making it the second largest liquid-dominated field in the world.
2. INTRODUCTION
Bulalo geothermal field is located about 70 km southeast of Manila on the island of Luzon (Figure 1, inset). The field is adjacent to a 0.5 Ma dacite dome on the SE flank of Mt. a Quaternary volcanic center (Figure 1). The field was discovered by Philippine Geothermal, (PGI), which is under contract to the National Power Corporation of the Philippine government. The discovery well was drilled in 1974, and commercial production began in 1979 with an installed plant capacity of 110 This was increased to 220 in 1980, and 330 in 1984; binary units totaling 15.73 were installed in early 1994. In 1993, the Bulalo power plants generated about 14% of the electricity demand of Luzon (Sussman et al., 1993).

Figure 1. Map of Bulalo field showing production and injection wells. Inset shows field location. Power plants shown are A-C (existing), D-E (planned) and 1-3 (binary).
Commercial scale geothermal brine injection in the Philippines was pioneered at Bulalo. From the start of geothermal operations 1974 (including the flowtests of the exploration wells) all of the produced brine has been injected back into the reservoir; about 60% of the total mass produced plus steam condensate from the power plants is currently injected. However, by 1988 the injection program was adversely the productivity of certain wells. Thermal breakthrough caused rapid declines in steam production and increased brine production. It was clear that a new injection strategy was necessary.
3. RESERVOIR DESCRIPTION
The Bulalo reservoir is a liquid-dominated, fracture-controlled hydrothermal system. The productive reservoir is approximately 7
and is roughly circular in plan view. The reservoir is bounded by hot, low-permeability rocks to the east and south, and by lower temperature rocks to the west (Clemente and Villadolid-Abrigo, 1993). Partially open boundaries have been identified on the north and west; the undrilled northwestern boundary is not known. The top of the reservoir occurs between 100 m and 1250 m below sea level It is shallowest near the center, deepens gradually to the west (Figure 2) and north, and deepens abruptly to the east and south. occurs in the central SE part of the reservoir. A porous volcanic tuff unit (Figure 2) provides an important fluid flowpath at the reservoir top; the bottom of the reservoir unknown. The reservoir fluid is a neutral-pH sodium chloride liquid with low total dissolved solids and low gas content relative to other geothermal systems in the Philippines. The fluid salinity is also low, with an average concentration of 2800 The average reservoir temperature is and the maximum temperature is around 300°C in the southeast sector of the field.

STA. MARIA ET
In September, 1994 the average total mass flow rate was 1095 with an average steam fraction of 56% at 1.2 separation pressure. Production wells produce two-phase fluids with discharge enthalpies ranging from 1,400 to 2,600 The average steam production per well is about 16 at commercial wellhead pressures (typically 1.0 to 1.2 MPag). Some wells are capable of producing at rates greater than 25 steam. Since 1979, the well steam flow capacity has declined at about 3.5% per year (Strobel, 1993).
4. RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
4.1 Description of the Injection System
The injection system in Bulalo consists of two sub-systems, the hot and cold brine systems. The hot brine injection system disposes of 177°C flashed brine discharged from the separators (135°C downstream of the binary plants). The cold injection system handles mainly steam condensate and cooling tower blowdown. With the field now generating 346 the hot brine and steam condensate injection rates are about 2.5 million and 0.5 million
respectively.
The cold water injection wells are located along the south margin of the field (Figure 3). The formation penetrated by the wells in this area is hot but has low permeability. The initial injectivity of the wells was poor, but significant improvement has been observed through time. This phenomenon has been attributed to hydrofracturing as the cold water interacts with the hot formation. Although the cold water injectors are located very near the production area (Figure 3), cold water injection has not been detrimental to production. This could be due to the lower injection rate in the southern injectors, or suggest that this area is hydrologically isolated from the reservoir. The hot brine injection wells are located west, east, and northeast of the field, generally within two kilometers of the reservoir. The injection pipeline system has a high degree of flexibility so that hot brine coming from any part of the field can be injected in any combination of the three areas.
4.2 Evolution of the Injection System
In the course of developing Bulalo, some exploration and delineation wells turned out to be poor producers. Several subcommercial producers drilled on the periphery of the field were used for injection. In particular, four wells drilled near the western edge of the producing field between 1979 and 1980 were initially
used for hot brine injection. These wells are Bul-43, -48, -54, and -58 (Figure 3); collectively they are called the ""western edgefield injectors.'' These wells intersected the margin of the productive reservoir but were poor producers with sub-commercial wellhead pressures. As injectors, each well can accept more than 0.5 million
of waste brine, and together these four wells are capable of accepting about two-thirds of the field's total hot brine production.
Eight years after the power plants were started, injected brine was detected during routine geochemical monitoring in seven production wells near the western boundary of the field observation was verified by tracer tests, and the rapid decrease in productivity and enthalpy of the affected wells. Figure 3 shows the area affected by injection breakthrough. The first production well to show a significant response was Bul-66 (Figure 3). Chemical, thermal, and production changes in this well are shown in Figure 4, along with the injection history of the western edgefield injectors. Rapid increases in concentration in Bul-66 were followed about six months later by thermal breakthrough and steam rate declines. Steam declines in the seven affected wells caused a maximum loss of starting 1989.
Injection breakthrough on a smaller scale also developed on the eastern side of the field (see Figure 6 in Villadolid, 1991). Two sub-commercial production wells used as hot brine injectors caused productivity declines of the neighboring wells. However, this problem was easily solved by promptly stopping injection into that area. The same is not true for the western edgefield injectors. In order to stop injecting the large volume of brine into the western edgefield injectors, about 2 million of new injection capacity had to be developed. PGI decided to drill four new, deeper injection wells further to the west and and three injectors northeast of the field (Bul-77, -78, and -82; Figure 3); seven outfield injectors were required to replace the four infield
Additional generation capacity is planned based on the results of reservoir simulation, as discussed above. By 1995-96, modular power plants consisting of 2x20 baseload and 2x20 standby capacity will begin operation (Figure These will raise the installed capacity of Bulalo field to 426 The 40 standby plants will be operated whenever any one of the existing 55 units is shut down for maintenance. Figure 5 illustrates how the proposed capacity additions will affect steam production rates through the year 2015.
5. CONCLUSIONS
experience in Bulalo has demonstrated that production and injection are closely linked and interdependent. An important key to successful reservoir management is to find an injection strategy that will preserve the resource and maximize its value. At Bulalo, moving injection has resulted in increasing value by reducing the number of required production and injection wells. Generation has been increased with the addition of binary units, and reservoir modeling supports a hrther expansion of field generation capacity.
ones due to the lower permeability rocks encountered farther from the reservoir. As new injection capacity was developed, injection into the western edgefield wells was gradually reduced, and then terminated in 1992. Most of the affected production wells showed a rapid decline in chloride concentration after injection was terminated in Bul-43 and -48. Bul-66 demonstrated a dramatic thermal recovery and a steam rate increase of 80% about 18 months after shutting in those two injection wells (Figure 4).
4.3 Reservoir Simulation: Realized and Anticipated Benefits
A conceptual model of the Bulalo reservoir was established in 1989 (Strobel, 1991). This model was input to a numerical model to predict reservoir response to changes in development. Predictive runs were made for the following cases: 1) not relocating injection, and 2) relocating injection wells further from productive wells (Strobel, 1991). Simulation results showed that by relocating injection to western outfield areas and to the NE, fewer production and injection wells would be needed for full field development. To maintain a generation capacity of 330 up to year 2015, 10 fewer production wells would be required than planned. The model showed that relocating injection would stabilize enthalpy, thereby reducing the waste brine by 2.5 million at the end of 20 years. This would eliminate the cost of 11 additional injection wells. A more immediate benefit was the productivity recovery of the wells previously affected by injection. The increased steam deliverability and enthalpy obviated the need for new production wells in 94.
The predicted field performance also suggested it was feasible to accelerate production through capacity additions. The model and results were published by Strobel (1993).
4.3 Ongoing and Future Developments
In 1994, generating capacity from binary units were installed. The binary units extract additional heat from the flashed brine before it is injected. A modification system ensures that the injection system is safeguarded against silica scaling.

INTRODUCTION
Dixie Valley is a fracture-dominated geothermal system located on the east side of the northern Stillwater Range in west-central Nevada. With a 62 megawatt power plant (operated by Oxbow Power Corp.), Dixie Valley is the largest non-volcanic geothermal system in the Basin and Range province. Although the circulation of geothermal fluids within the field is dominantly controlled by fracture permeability along the still-active rangefront fault (the Stillwater normal fault), most wells produce from a zone of fractured Jurassic-age rock located above the trace of the main fault. These Jurassic rocks have undergone a long and complicated structural history that includes both Mesozoic compressional and Cenozoic extensional events (Plank, 1996). Our studies have focussed on the post-Oligocene alteration of these rocks, and the relationship and cumulative effect of these alteration events upon the permeability of the current geothermal reservoir (Lutz et al., 1996; 1997). From our petrographic and fluid inclusion work, we now recognize six major mineral assemblages that represent alteration events associated with the early stages of Basin and Range extension and the evolution of the Dixie Valley geothermal system. I ~
The purpose of this paper is to refine our model of the alteration history of reservoir rocks in the Dixie Valley geothermal field based on new information obtained from fluid-inclusion analyses and petrographic observations from wells located outside of the main producing area. The objective is to understand the history of fluid flow along faults and the alteration events that have affected the permeability of the present geothermal reservoir.
METHODS
Cutting samples from six Dixie Valley geothermal wells were studied in thin-section to determine rock type and the distribution and paragenetic relationships among the secondary minerals. X-ray diffraction techniques were used to characterize the clay minerals and to determine the percentages of mineral phases in the rock. Fluid-inclusion analyses of vein material yielded the homogenization temperatures and apparent salinities of the fluids that produced the alteration minerals. Mineral geothermometers are compared with the inclusion temperatures and downhole thermal measurements to assess the evolutionary changes that have occurred since the secondary minerals were formed.
Fluid-inclusion analyses were made on polished thinsections of well cutting samples from production wells 45-33, 82-5, 73B-7, and 52-18, and from wells 62-21 and 66-21 located to the southeast and southwest, respectively, of the field (Fig. 1). Most of the
vein fragments collected from the well cuttings. In addition, fluid inclusions in scale deposits from geothermal well 76-7 were studied. Preliminary fluid inclusion analyses were also performed on vein samples from the Dixie Comstock mine and Mirrors outcrop localities. A total of 550 fluid inclusions were measured.
ALTERATION MINERALOGY
In our previous studies, we described four major stages of alteration related to the Stillwater fault system (Lutz et al., 1996; 1997). However, based on our more recent fluid inclusion and petrographic work, we now recognize at least six post-Oligocene alteration assemblages in the Jurassic reservoir rocks at Dixie Valley. From oldest to youngest they are: Stage I) epidote-chlorite-calcite veins; Stage 11) illite; Stage 111) wairakite-quartz-calcite-potassium feldsparepidote veins; Stage IV) mixed-layer illite-smectite and quartz-calcite veins; Stage V) chalcedonic quartzdolomite-calcite-chlorite/smectite-barite-hematite
thermometric measurements were made on calcite veins; and Stage VI) quartz-calcite veins.
In central portions of the geothermal field, wairakite veins are present in the Jurassic reservoir rocks of the deep production wells. In thin-section, the wairakitequartz-calcite veins appear fresh and occur in sericitized rock. Figure 2 graphically displays the relationships between the mineral and fluid-inclusion thermometry and the location of lost circulation zones in well 45-33 RD-2. Because wairakite commonly forms at temperatures above 240°C and present production fluids in this well are about 248""C, we con-
cluded in our previous study that the wairakite veins probably were deposited by the modern geothermal system.
Our recent petrographic studies indicate that wairakite veins are also found in wells 62-21 and 66-21, located in cool areas outside of the main productive area. In well 62-2 1 with maximum measured temperatures of about 180°C, traces of wairakite are present in Jurassic rocks at 8300 ft. In well 66-21, wairakite

veins are common from 5600 ft to 6600 ft in the Jurassic igneous complex. The wairakite occurs with prehnite, quartz and calcite in veins that appear to be associated with the presence of andesitic dikes and epidote alteration in the Jurassic section. Also present in this interval are laumontite-calcite veins that record deposition by much cooler fluids (Browne, 1993). These laumontite veins are more likely related to the current thermal regime as maximum measured temperatures are about 150°C in this well. Thus, the wairakite probably formed as a result of an older, hotter hydrothermal event.

(Dilek and Moores, 1995). If the illite in the Dixie, Valley drillholes is the same age as sericite from the nearby Dixie Comstock mine (K-Ar dates of 11 to 15 Ma; Vikre, 1994), then it is likely that both the Stagd' I1 illite and the Stage [I1 wairakite assemblages in the drillholes are related to Miocene alteration events, The presence of mixed-layer illite-smectite of the Stage IV assemblage, and the chalcedony and dolomite of the Stage V assemblage suggests cooler alteration events that post-date Miocene faulting, basaltic volcanism and dike intrusion.

Most of tne rluia-inclusion data comes trom calcite vein fragments from the deep production wells,
Figure 3 is a plot of homogenization temperatures (Th) versus the temperature of ice melting (Tm-ice) in
vein samples from well 45-33 RD-2. The data suggest the presence of two distinct populations of fluid inclusions in the Jurassic section. One group has ice melting temperatures of less than -0.4""C (greater than 0.7 wt % NaCl equivalent) and homogenization temperatures of 235"" to 300°C. The second group has lower apparent salinities, up to 0.5 wt % NaCl equivalent (Tm-ice of -0.3""C) and homogenization temperatures of 200"" to 270°C.
Scale from geothermal well 76-7 was deposited by present-day boiling fluids in the wellbore. Inclusions in the scale yielded homogenization temperatures of 200°C and apparent salinities of 0.18 to 0.4 wt % NaCl equivalent (Tm-ice of -0.1 to -0.2 ""C). Part of the lower salinity population of vein inclusions from well 45-33 formed under similar conditions as the calcite scale (Fig. 3). This suggests that some of the calcite in the reservoir rocks was deposited by modern geothermal fluids.
Although fluid-inclusion temperatures for wairakite veins from well 45-33 (Fig. 3, Th = 235°C) are similar to the temperature of the production fluids in this well (Tmax = 248""C), the salinity data indicate that the inclusion fluids are too saline (up to 1.2 wt % NaCl equivalent) to have been produced by the modern geothermal system (fluids with 0.1 to 0.2 wt % NaCl).
Fluid inclusions from calcite veins in the marginal 66- 21 and 62-21 wells, and from calcite in quartz breccia samples collected at the Mirrors and Dixie Comstock mine outcrops yielded limited data. The calcite samples contained few fluid inclusions and many of these were stretched or necked. The inclusions homogenized at low temperatures (less than 180°C) and although no salinity measurements were obtained, they generally appear to be of low salinity. Vikre (1994) studied similar fluid inclusions in vein calcite from the Dixie Comstock mine and concluded that these late-stage veins formed at low temperatures (160"" to 1 80°C) from essentially meteoric fluids.
In general, it is not possible to assign a particular calcite vein fragment to a specific alteration assemblage because the individual well cuttings are small and usually do not contain the complete vein assemblage, and the vein assemblages are not mineralogically distinctive. Calcite and quartz are very common vein minerals and occur in most of the alteration assemblages described in this study. Using known thermal stabilities of the alteration minerals as a guide
(Browne, 1993), we can predict which groups of fluid-inclusion data may be associated with the individual alteration events. For example, using X-ray diffraction data from 8100 ft in well 73B-7, mixedlayer illite-smectite (Stage N alteration) appears to have formed between 180"" and 220°C (Lutz et al., 1996). Fluid-inclusion study of this sample reveals that inclusions with homogenization temperatures of 180"" to 220°C generally have apparent salinities of 0.4 to 0.5% NaCl. Following this integrated approach for other samples, the fluid-inclusion data yield the following temperatures and apparent salinities in weight percent NaCl equivalent for each of the alteration assemblages: Stage I) epidote-chlorite-calcite veins, 270"" to 325°C and 1.4 to 1.6%; Stage 11) illite, 220"" to 270°C and 1.6 to 1.9%; Stage 111) wairakitequartz-calcite-potassium feldspar-epidote veins, 230"" to 240°C and 1.2%; Stage IV) mixed-layer illitesmectite and quartz-calcite veins, 180"" to 220°C and 0.4 to 0.5%; Stage V) chalcedonic quartz-dolomitecalcite-chlorite/smectite-barite-hematite veins, <160""C and 0.0%; and Stage VI) quartz-calcite veins, 200"" to 270°C and 0.0 to 0.5%.
DISCUSSION
Compared with fluid-inclusion studies conducted on samples from the southern Stillwater Range (Parry et al., 1991; Hedderly-Smith, 1997), the fluid inclusions in the Dixie Valley geothermal reservoir generally appear to be less saline, contain less C02, and have lower homogenization temperatures. Parry et al. record homogenization temperatures of up to 400""C, salinities up to 39 weight percent NaCl in halite-bearing inclusions, and substantial C02 in clathrate-bearing inclusions. They also record the presence of an early biotite-potassium feldspar assemblage and late Oligocene-early Miocene sericite alteration. Using hydrothermal alteration products, and fluid-inclusion temperatures, pressures, and compositions, they estimate up to 6 km of vertical displacement of the footwall of the Dixie Valley fault. In the hanging wall of the Stillwater fault in northern Dixie Valley, most of the fluid inclusions are only moderately saline and there is no evidence for significant amounts of C02. Sericite alteration at the nearby Dixie Comstock mine is mid-Miocene in age. Stratigraphic relationships suggest only about 3 km of offset between Miocene basalts in the northern Stillwater Range and those in the adjacent Dixie Valley geothermal field.
The differences observed in the alteration mineralogy and fluid-inclusion data between footwall rocks of the
southern Stillwater Range and the hanging wall reservoir rocks in northern Dixie Valley represent differences in the timing of Cenozoic structural events in the region. Vikre (1994) recognized three major epochs of faulting and thermal activity in the Dixie Valley area; the earliest occurring during the late Oligocene-early Miocene, a mid-Miocene episode, and a Quaternary episode. In the southern Stillwater Range, Oligocene activity appears to be represented by high temperature and salinity fluid inclusions, and sericite that has yielded ages of 21-25 Ma (Parry et al., 1991). The high fluid-inclusion temperatures suggest that this event may have been related to magmatic-hydrothermal alteration and late Oligocene faulting and tilting of the Stillwater caldera complex (Hudson and Geissman, 1991; John, 1995). The Stage I inclusions found in the Dixie Valley geothermal field, which yielded temperatures of up to 325""C, and the associated epidote-bearing assemblages, may be possible manifestations of this Oligocene event.
eralization clearly related to the modem geothermal activity is poorly constrained by cross-cutting relationships in the well cuttings, geochemical modeling by Bruton et al. (1997) indicates that calcite and quartz should be stable mineral phases within the present reservoir. We have found fluid inclusions in calcite vein fragments with temperatures and salinities that are consistent with the reservoir fluids in the Jurassic reservoir rocks. These inclusions yielded an I average temperature of about 230°C and salinities ranging from 0.0 to 0.5 weight percent NaCl equivalent. In well 45-33, part of the low-salinity inclusion population exhibits homogenization temperatures of up to 270OC. Since the maximum fluid temperature in this well is about 248""C, this suggests some cooling of the modern geothermal system since its emplacement along the Stillwater fault.
SUMMARY
In the northern Stillwater Range, mid-Miocene activity is represented by sericite that has been dated at 11- 15 Ma at the Dixie Comstock mine (Vikre, 1994) and by andesitic dikes dated by Dilek and Moores (1995). Stage I1 illite alteration and andesitic dikes encountered in the geothermal wells may be of similar ages. In the wells, the dikes are associated with the presence of Stage 111 wairakite-quartz-calcite-prehnite veins. Fluid inclusions from these veins have homogenization temperatures averaging 235°C and salinities of 1.2 weight percent NaCl equivalent.
Carbonate-barite veining, gold mineralization and associated quartz sinters at the Dixie Comstock mine (Vikre, 1994) represent Quaternary thermal events. From fluid-inclusion and stable isotope determinations, Vikre showed that the mineralizing fluids were meteoric waters with relatively low temperatures. Based on the offset and stratigraphic position of fossil hot-spring sinters along the Dixie Comstock fault, Vikre concluded that the mineralization was midPleistocene in age. We suggest, based on the similarities in the composition of the Stage V mineral assemblage in the geothermal wells (chalcedonic quartzcalcite-dolomite-barite-hematite), that this stage was contemporaneous with mineralization at the Comstock mine. Stage V inclusions record temperatures of less than 160°C and salinities of zero.
The presence of chalcedony within the present-day geothermal reservoir is inconsistent with its thermal stability (Fig. 2; and Fournier, 1985). Although min-
Fluid inclusions from the central portions of the Dixie, Valley geothermal field record deposition from multiple thermal events. Although temperatures vary from 120"" to 325"" C, the fluids related to these events generally appear to have been of low to moderate salinity. Fluid inclusions with moderate apparent salinities (1.2 to 1.9 wt % NaCl equivalent) correspond to thosa with the higher homogenization temperatures (235""ta 325°C) that represent the older (pre- late Miocene] Stage I to I11 alteration assemblages. Field relation4 ships and petrographic analyses suggest that the Staga I1 sericite (illite) and Stage 111 wairakite veins represent Miocene alteration events associated with northnorthwest faulting and intrusion of andesitic dikes during the initial stages of Basin and Range extension in the northern Dixie Valley area. The fluids associated with these events are represented by moderatesalinity fluid inclusions (1.2 to 1.9 wt % NaCl equivalent) with homogenization temperatures in the 220"" to 270°C range. Descent of the hanging wall of the northeast-trending Stillwater fault occurred after the deposition of Miocene basalt flows and dike intrusion. Low-salinity Stage IV and V fluid inclusions suggest the presence of cool fluids at shallow depths along the Stillwater fault. Stage VI quartz and calcite veins appear to have been deposited by the modem geothermal system (Tmax = 248""C, salinity = 0.1-0.2 wt %) after the Jurassic rocks descended to their present depth of 2-3 km along this still-active fault. Stage VI fluid inclusions with zero salinity and homogenization temperatures of up to 270°C may , represent slightly higher fluid temperatures earlier in the history of the modern geothermal system.

Presentday fluid inclusions deposited in wellbore scale yield homogenization temperatures of about 200°C and salinities of 0.0 to 0.4 weight percent NaCl equivalent. Moderately saline fluids of the Stage I through 111 assemblages appear to be associated with hydrothermal systems that developed during initial Basin and Range extension. Low salinity and low temperature Stage JV and V inclusions suggest the presence of cool fluids at shallow depths along the Stillwater fault. Stage VI quartz and calcite veins were deposited by the modern geothermal system (Tmax = 248""C, salinity = 0.1-0.2 wt %) along this still-active fault. INTRODUCTION Dixie Valley is a fracture-dominated geothermal system located on the east side of the northern Stillwater Range in west-central Nevada. With a 62 megawatt power plant (operated by Oxbow Power Corp.), Dixie Valley is the largest non-volcanic geothermal system in the Basin and Range province. Although the circulation of geothermal fluids within the field is dominantly controlled by fracture permeability along the still-active rangefront fault (the Stillwater normal fault), most wells produce from a zone of fractured Jurassic-age rock located above the trace of the main fault. These Jurassic rocks have undergone a long and complicated structural history that includes both Mesozoic compressional and Cenozoic extensional events (Plank, 1996). Our studies have focussed on the post-Oligocene alteration of these rocks, and the relationship and cumulative effect of these alteration events upon the permeability of the current geothermal reservoir (Lutz et al., 1996; 1997). From our petrographic and fluid inclusion work, we now recognize six major mineral assemblages that represent alteration events associated with the early stages of Basin and Range extension and the evolution of the Dixie Valley geothermal system.

SUMMARY
The Palinpinon I Production field (PAL I) has been exploited since 1983. Problems encountered on well utilization in order to meet the load demand is discussed relative to the field response. Field chemical and thermodynamic behavior monitoring proved to be one important factor in maintaining optimum performance of the Palinpinon-I Field,
BRIEF HISTORY OF PROJECT
Geothermal exploration in Negros Island started in 1973. Detailed geochemical, geological and resistivity surveys were conducted in 1975 at Mt. solfatara, Okoy Valley (Valencia) and Tagbak Mag-aso (Dauin) by NPC and DSIR, then PNOC and KRTA.
PNOC-EDC took over the project from NPC in 1976 where the first well was drilled in September that year. In 1980, the Puhagan area was decided to be developed for the initial 112.5 plant. Drilling of 21 production wells and injection wells were completed and the power plant was commissioned in 1983. Since then, two production wells and seven injection wells were added.
DESCRIPTION OF PAL-I FCDS
The rugged terrain of the Puhagan area called for the adoption of directional drilling making the FCDS a compact type development, The production and injection wells were drilled on multi-well pads (fig. 1 ) . The single flash separation is done at the central flash station where steam and water are separated at 6.0 kscg. Steam is supplied to the power plant at 5.0 - 5.5 kscg depending on the load demand. Except for the cutting of the production and injection wells, the FCDS is operated automatically using electro-pneumatic control system.
F I E L D PERFORMANCE FOR THE FIRST T E N YEARS
The early stage of field exploitation was limited to few wells utilized due to low load demand. The load is largely domestic and peaked for almost four hours in the evening.
A. PLANT LOADING
The power plant was originally planned to supply power to several mining firms and partly to residential consumers in the Negros Island. Unfortunately, when the power plant was commissioned in 1983 the mining firms closed down. In effect, the load demand from 1983 to 1989 was limited to the power requirement of the sugar centrals and households within the Negros Island. Full load was only attained on October 1990 when the neighboring island of Panay was interconnected to the system through a submarine cable.
B. EARLY RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE INJECTION STRATEGY
The low load demand gave the opportunity to test the various sector of the production area vis a vis injection well utilization. Several injection well utilization strategies were adopted (see Table 1 ) . However, they were a l l found to be ineffective as the injection line chloride, which is indicative of the injection fluid returns, still showed a consistent increase from 5750 to as

237 C. TO INCREASE STEAM
CAPABILITY
The full load operation was initially programed in April To prepare for such eventuality, measures were also planned to meet the steam requirement. This was attacked on two fronts, change. in injection strategy and augment the dwindling steam supply. The objective then was to ensure a stem supply of over 112.5 and for flexibility.
CHANGE I N INJECTION
This was realized in October 1989 when waste water injection was shifted to the Malaunay (Fig. sector which became available one year ahead of the full load operation of the plant in October 1990. The change in injection strategy, successfully reduced the field injection fluid returns into the Puhagan sector from 74% t o 45% which consequently resulted to an increase in field enthalpy and improvement in steam capability (Table 2, Fig. 2B).
high as 11400 since the initial exploitation period (fig. This massive injection returns resulted to declines in output, enthalpy, and downhole temperatures on some production wells. One notable example is PN-26, a vertical well drilled in the central Puhagan area, which became unproductive since December 1988 and has not recovered up t o 'the present even with the shift in injection to the area. To impede this effect, as early as 1985, an evaluation was made to transfer jection elsewhere.

2. HOOK-UP OF ADDITIONAL ACIDICING PRODUCTION WELLS
An increase in steam supply was attained when was drilled and commissioned in April 1991 with an output of 2 The output further increased to when the well was acidized in April 1993.
OK2 was originally a condensate well for the Pal I power plant with an initial output of 2.3 As the field developed a steam cap as a result of full load operation and injection return reduction, the well output improved to 6.6 It was connected and utilized since October 1991 without any sign of output decline.
3. TWO PHASE INTERCONNECTION
The original construction of the Pal-I FCDS was arranged in such a manner that three or more production wells were interconnected and fed to a dedicated pair of separator vessels. However, in view of the decline in output as an after effect of injection returns into the production sector, some vessels had become underloaded while others were overloaded. This has become an operational constraint particularly during vessel maintenance in which case the associated wells are also shut down. To allow maintenance flexibility and t o ensure full load steam capability at any given time, the two-phase interconnection piping system was installed and commissioned in May 1990.
FULL LOAD OPERATION PRESENT FIELD PERFORMANCE
The full load operation of PAL I started in October 17, when Panay load was connected to the grid. But prior to such eventuality, the transfer of the bulk of the fluid injection was already effected (October 1989) and the two-phase interconnection was also made available (May 1990). To further enhance steam capability, two production wells were added, on April 1991 and OK2 on October 1991. The full load operation subjected PAL I to its optimum production and options to increase steam production were proven useful.
However, even with the transfer of fluid injection to the area, mass breakthrough of injection fluids to the production sector, although of less magnitude compared to Puhagan injection, was still observed. Waste water disposal in one well however, facilitated an inflow of reheated injection fluid that suppressed the acid-sulphate fluid component in some wells, particularly those which had intersected the Odlumon fault. The above observations indicated that steam supply has now become largely sensitive to injection strategy.
Production wells characteristics were found out to have changed daily, even hourly, that using the output measurements results as basis for daily total steam availability, at times became impractical or not applicable a t all. Due to operational constraints, well availability to the system and environmental concerns, one time output ements could not be done on all the production wells with the present method adopted (James method). This made the maintenance of a stable steam production a major concern during full load operation. This concern i s reduced t o the unavailability of an effective daily field output trend monitoring. To ascertain the said deficiency, a simple monitoring technique was developed in December 1990 to monitor field steam performance using the plant as a gauge. This technique is explained by the equation:
FIELD STEAM = PLANT STEAM + VENT STEAM + WELLHEAD RESERVE.
239
The WELLHEAD RESERVE is the equivalent output measurement steam flow which can easily be verified by actual output testing since this is limited to at most two wells at any given time.
The VENT STEAM can be establishing a curve fit opening and the equivalent blown o f f . calculated by between valve steam flow
The PLANT STEAM is the summation of the steam equivalent of the actual load, the no load steam and the steam used t o drive the steam gas ejectors. The conversion of the actual load to its steam equivalent is done by using the turbine steam rate and applying a correction factor due to vacuum pressure' changes (fig. 3 fig. 4 ) .

Combining it with the injection line chloride monitoring and individual well chemical data, monitoring of wellhead pressures, occasional output testing, and injection well capacity testing, this technique can ably assist the operations engineer in assessing well utilization schedules and the other scientists in managing the field.
An example is shown in fig. 5, when was brought into service in February 1993, the field capability abruptly declined, likewise, after acidicing in May 1993 (capacity increased from 30 to 187 Here, the culprit injection well is easily identified, then looking at the wellhead pressures which are monitored daily and the chemical data, the affected production wells can also be easily identified. To ascertain the effect on the output, the affected production wells can be put off line and be subjected to output testing. More so , production and injection well utilization can easily be prioritized.
However, with the increasing awareness of the environmental effects from the wastewater discharges to the river, efforts are exerted to do away with well output

CONCLUSION
Palinpinon I field is a structurally controlled reservoir and is very sensitive to changes in injection strategy. By using an effective monitoring technique, production and injection well utilization can easily be prioritized. The adoption of such technique can be a useful aid in:
1. Identifying the specific wells which need close monitoring hence, subject them to a specialized uti1izat ion.

CAROL TENoPIP OF THE UH SCHUUL OF LIBRAPY bCIENCE TU FULLUW UP ON THE INITIAL INQUIRY I MADE OF HER ABOUT FINDING A TEMPORARY COMPUTER TRAINED LIBRARIAN TU IMPLEMENT THE REPUbIToRY FUNCTION UF THIS UFFICE, TO BE FUNDED FRUM THE RCUH CUNTRACT. I PHUNED THE UNIVERSITY ON .JULY 13, 1989 AND SPUKE TU THE DIRECTOR UF LIBRARY bTUDIES, DR . .JACKbUN. HE INFURMED ME THAT DR. TENUPIR Ib AWAY UNTIL THE LATTER PART OF AUGUST. I EXPLAINED WHAT I WANTED TO SPEAK TU HER ABUUT, AND HE bAlD HE WOULD SEND ME A FURM TU FILL OUT IN URDER TO FILL UUR .JUB REQUEbT. TO DATE THE FORM HAS NUT ARRIVED. AT THIS POINT, IF THERE IS NU URGENCY, IT MIGHT BE WISER TO WAIT AND SPEAK WITH DR. TENUPIR, SINCE SHE WAb THE PERSON RECOMMENDED TO TALK TO BY THE LIBRARIAN WHU bUCCESSFULLY STARTED A DATA BASE FOR DBED (MS. MARILYN MOORE). UNLESS YUU ADVISE ME THERE IS MORE URGENCY, I WILL WAIT UNTIL LATTER AUGUST AND SPEAK TU DR. TENUPIR.
AT THE SAME MEETING WHEN YOU ASKED ME TO CUNTACT DR. TENoPIR, YOU SAID YOU WOULD LUUK AFTER THE PUBLIC RELATIUNS PART OF THE RCUH CONTRACT TO GET SoMEUNE UN BOARD FUR THAT POSITIUN. I DON'T KNOW THE STATUS OF THAT EFFORT.
ON THE RCUH CONTRACT, THERE HAS BEEN A PRUBLEM WITH DAGS DUE TO THE FACT THAT AN INDIVIDUAL OTHER THAN DR. MATSUDA SIGNED THE CONTRACT FUR DR. MATSUDA. DAGS IS REQUIRING A NOTARIZED STATEMENT FROM THE INDIVIDUAL (MR. GILBERT USHIMA, COMPTROLLER OF RCUH) STATING THAT HE IS THE CoMPTRULLER. (WE HAVE ANOTHER DUCUMENT THAT SAYS OTHERS ARE ALLUWED TU SIGN, BUT IT DOES NOT SPECIFICALLY NAME OSHIMA.) WHEN DR. MATSUDA FOUND OUT ABOUT MR. OSHIMA'S SIGNATURE BEING QUESTIONED HE APPARENTLY WAS UPSET (ACCORDING TO CORA CHAI, RCUH STAFF) AND INITIATED PHONE CALLS TO FIND OUT WHY THIS RELATIVELY ROUTINE MATTER WAS BEING QUESTIONED. THE OUTCOME, PER ROY IN FISCAL, IS THAT DAGb IS NOW REQUIRING UNLY THIS NOTARIZED STATEMENT FROM MR. OSHIMA, A DUCUMENT THAT HE HAS BEEN PROVIDING TO OTHER AGENCIES WHEN HE SIGNS FOR DR. MATSUDA (ACCORDING TO ROY HE DID THIS FOR AQUATIC PESoURCES).

2. Revisions to rules - are they substantive enough to require second public hearing? Need to go over Thielen's analysis - easy to add ""inter-vF..!nol""·"" to dE~finitions:; f.'?''':\~:;y to copy f.~:,;actly LUC's rules, not attempt paraphrase as I did in proposed rules; easy to add a provision providing for direct appeal. On transfer of functions from LUC under 205.5, it is really hard to figure out what the statute means and therefore what is actually transferred. This is the part that evoked such uproar about home rule, and yet neither Randy Young nor LUC mentioned leaving out the County's r61e. (LUC's response letter is dated 6/21/89 to Manabu - this needs to be adressed also, but over the phone the suggestions sounded pretty mild)"" To resolve the wording on this matter, perhaps Thielen's language could be used. If the County Planning Commission's decision is subject to LUC approval, approval with modifications, or denial, then the wording of 13-185-3 (b) could be ""After County Planning·Commission approval, the department shall review and consider issuing special permits ••• """" Randy Young (and Ray Young of LUC suggested this in conversation) asked if there shouldn't be standards for issuing the permit. The same standards could be used as in 205-5,,1: ""Thee clepart,meIT!:. sh'::i.ll i SSW? a spec i "",'II pt::~nld. t. :i. fit finds that. t.he applicant has demonst.rated by a preponderance of the evidence that~ (1) the desired uses would not. have unreasonable adverse Ilealth, environmental, or socia-economic effects on residents or surrounding property~ and (2) The desired uses would not unreasonably burden public agencies to provide roads and street~, sewers, water, drainage, school improvements, and polioe and fire protection; and (3) That there are reasonable measures available to mit.igate t.he unreasonable adverse effects or burdens referred 'tel abDve""

The Perry's suggestions are that 1) adjacent landowners be notified of any possible district boundary amendment or change in zoning.

It is hard to say, given the range of application types that may come into the process, whether one year is too long a period to impose on every application that comes through the process"" For a 500 MW consortium type project. that comes in one huge application, one year will be a short time for processing all the required permits"" In this case wording to that effect could be considered. One year could be too long for certain smaller aspects of a larger project, for example if an application were submitted through the 301 process to build support facilities in the area prior to drilling. I am not sure this arbitrary t.ime limit should be imposed without knowing if it is meaniingful or not in terms of the entire range of types of applications to be submitted.

Barbara Bell '5 suggestions include establishing an Environmental Compliance Officer to be funded half by the geothermal industry_ Perhaps this would be an appropriate position to fund through the monitoring and enforcement sections of the act. My reading however is that the enforcement functions only apply to tranferred functions. (The proposed rules go outside DLNR's 301-authorized bounds on the enforcement side, but no one complained about that.)
Bell asks for the information function to include information to the public, not just for developers (we have already been giving information to the public, at least on one occasion, a student requested information).

5. 301 Administrative Rules review -
Comments from 8&F regarding transfer of functions from DOT - request 301 group""s opinion. B&F suggestion is to leave out confusing wording; DOT reviewed and left wording as proposed. Key area is can CDUA and DLNR differ in views over application - if Department differs (in DOT's role) then separate application would be necessary. Per Tom Fujikawa WT DOT this only comes up rarely, such as in the Ala Wai or off W <:;1, i k :i. k :i. 1/\) 1""1 E'f""l 1""1 <:~. \I :i. (J <::""1. t :i.

DOT apparently read the proposed rules as CDUA and DLNR (department) taking on these cheCk and balance roles even within a single agency, whereas B~F read £hem as contradictory and confusing.
Second comment from Ray Young of Land Use CommissIon questioning whether special permits for changes in land uses should be tranferred to DLNR - his reading of the Act is that this portion (b) of 205-3.1 does not relate to changes in :.: em in g an d t h .?r- ,~+ Dr- f::~ 'sheiu 1 oj not. he t;j"""""" an sf E?f-I'-' eci "" i'\y t-· f.~acJ i i""i C) of the act was to include 205-5 as an entity and therefore 1 picked up each part of it. including part (b). Also he expressed concern that the careful criteria tor boundary changes that are followed by Land Use Commission were not picked up in our rules. These criteria are in 205-17. I only picked up what was in 205-3.1 et seq. followinq the reference in the Act.
I asked if we could sit down and go over these things in a meeting. Ray said he would go over his concerns with Mrs. Ueda, meanwhile sending us a copy of his comments. After she has had a chance to conSIder his comments he will let us know if a meeting would be helpful.

~ICE OF RESCHEDULED PUBLIC H~NG state of Hawaii
DEPARTMENT OF LAND AND NATURAL RESOURCES Division of Water and Land Development
Proposed Administrative Rules for Geothermal and cable System Development Permitting
Public hearings will be held by the Division of water and Land Development, Department of Land and Natural Resources, to receive testtmony on the proposed administrative rules to implement Act 301, Session Laws of Hawaii, 1988, ""Geothermal and cable System Development permitting Act of 1988"".
Act 301 provides for a consolidated permitting process for geothermal and cable system development projects, in which the Department of Land and Natural Resources shall be the lead agency. It provides coordination among agencies in order to streamline the often duplicative permitting requirements of the various agencies and it provides for developing a consolidated application form.

J
Jdrr,ti3rr Staff "";'iter
A Wyoming-based company with an office in Honolulu announced plans yesterday to begin drilling an exploratory geothermal well in' Big Island's Puna District by the second half of this year.
Hank True, managing partner of True Geothermal Energy Co.. said in a telephone interview from Wyoming yesterday that his firm has submitted the final documents necessary to begin drilling.
.. A lot is still riding on the permit process, but we expect to begin work on the access road and to do some of the preltmtnary aite work -in the next couple of months,"" True said.
Final state approval to begin the drilling should be received ""momentarily"" from-the Board of Land and· Natural Resources and the Department of Health. True said.
At present. the firm is gear-' ing up to send a drilling rig, formerly used for oil exploration. to the Big Island. The rig is capable of drilling to a depth of 22.000 feet. but True said the geothermal wells on Camp-
bell Estate land will probably be no deeper than 7.000 feet. The big rig will allow the company to ""slant drill"" so that surface environmental disruption at the well site can be kept to a minimum.
The conservation district use permit issued by the state will allow True Geothermal to drill .as many wells as necessary to produce 100 megawatts of electricity. True said. ""Wild-guess"" estimates show that each well will cost $1.5 million to $2 million to drill. he said.-
""We plan to take things one step at a time. The reality is that we can only process about 25 megawatts of electricity at the present."" _ True said.
Those initial 25 megawatts of electricity will be sold to Hawaii Electric Light Co. to meet Big Island electricity needs. Once that is accomplished,
True said the company hopes , to supply as much as 100 of; the 500 megawatts of geother- I mal-generated electricity Ha-! waiian Electric hopes to begin - delivering to Oahu by 1995 via : an undersea cable.;
(Five hundred megawatts: represents about half of Oahu's ; energy usage today.)
True said his company is r subleasing the Puna site's min- : eral rites from Campbell Es· . tate, which holds the master lease to state-owned property.
While the promise of geo. thermal power has been discussed for nearly two decades • only a state-run. 2.2-megawatt demonstration plant is in operation today.
But at least one other private sector firm. Nevada-based Ormatt Energy Systems. plans to have a 12.5-megawatt system on line by the end of the year.

G-power zoning request opposed
Noise is driving people from their homes, pollution is threatening their health, and property values are plummeting in the neighborhood surrounding an experimental HGP-A geothermal energy producing plant in Poihiki.
That is what several residents from the area said when testifying Thursday against a proposal to rezone additional Pohoiki property for ge9thermal drilling.
Landowner Roy Matsumoto, seeking to change the zoning on 40 acres to allow geothermal drilling and exploration in Pohoiki was met with emotional opposition from neighboring property owners at a hearing of the state Board of Land and Natural Resources in Hilo.
Matsumoto wants to change the zoning of his property from agricultural to Geothermal Resource Subzone, which would allow drilling and exploration for geothermal energy.
Matsumoto wants to combine
the property with 18 acres he already owns adjacent to the existing HGP-A experimental gerothermal energy plant to form a 58-acre geothermal industrial park. ,
The three-megawatt HGP-A plant was started in 1981 by Natural Energy Laboratories of Hawaii under a contract with Hawaii Electric Light Co.
Matsumoto said he needs the rezoning becaqse farmingt. not I profitable o~ hiS p~perty.
Matsumoto said 'however that he doesn't iritend to drill exploratory wells. He only wants to use it for potential commercial users who would .use energy drawn from ~otentiill wells on his existing property or the HGP-A plant.
Several people, including Maurice Kaya of the state Department of Business and Economic Development, told the board Matsumoto does not need
See G-POWER, Page 8
G-POWER: Z'oning request· opposed
,'I'
From Page 1
to rezone for the commercial agricultural projects he wants on the property.
And residents of neighboring properties, fearing the drilling of new wells, complained about noise, air pollution, poor maintenance and declining property values as a result of the existing HGP-A plant.
A Leilani Estates subdvision resident broke down in tears while telling board members of
,'. his seven-year struggle for relief from pollution generated by the' nearby HGP-A plant.
Whenever the plant is vented he must leave his home and take his animals because the noise is unbearable, he said, and the value of his home has dropped to $5,000 from $12,000 when he bought it in 1981.
Another Leilani Estates resident who is also a real estate agent in Puna said property values surrounding the HGP-A plant have dropped about 60 percent since the plant was built.
Dave Laughlin said the proposed project would make him ""thin meat in a geothermal sandwich."" His property is located
within a mile of the HGP-A plant and approximately 1,000 feet from the site of several proposed new geothermal ""observation holes"" proposed to be dug in a separate project on each side of. his property. Matsumoto's parcel proposed for rezoning is adjacent to the rear of Laughlin's property.
Laughlin wants the state either to require a buffer of at least 3,500 feet between geothermal wells and homes or to buy the homes.
""I'm going to be right down wind from it,"" he said.
The public hearing is technically still open for comments either for or against the project for 15 days following Thursday's meeting !n Hilo, said Manabu Tagomorl, manager of the Water and Land Development division.
The DLNR staff will then review the testimony and transcript of the hearing and prepare a recommendation for the Board of Natural Land and Resources which wil decide whether t~ rezone the property.
The staff recommendation should· be ready by June Tagomori said. '

KEALAKEHE. Hawaii - Ralph Palikapu Dedman. a leader of the Pele Defense Fund that took its effort to stop geothermal development to the U.S. Supreme Court. was charged yesterday with 15 gun and drug counts.
Dedman and two other Ka'u men were ar-
Dedman
rested Saturday by Kona Vice officers at the end of what officials said was a two-month surveillance that included federal drug agents and officers from several police units.
Police spokesman Lt. Daniel Minan yesterday said Dedman was charged with 10 firearms counts for the shotgun and four rifles police seized at his Wailau home. mauka of Pahala. He also was charged with five drug offenses. including
commercial promotion of marijuana. He was held in the Kana cellblock in lieu of S6.925 bail last night. and was expected to be transferred to Hilo jail.
Dedman was arrested with a Pahala man, age 40. and a Volcano man. age 42, at his Wailau property Saturday where police said they had been tending marijuana patches in the mauka .\'inole and Wail au areas.
The other two were released while a case is prepared for the grand jury.
The three suspects were observed for more than two months by members of the intelligence unit. vice section and criminal investiga-

tion section as well as Drug Enforcement Administration agents, according to pOlice detective Julian Shiroma.
When the raid was conducted Saturday, police seized a pound of freshly harvested marijuana. 320 plants ranging to four feet. 1.2 pounds of processed marijuana and 46 black pills that are still undergoing laboratory analysis.
Dedman has' been an outspoken opponent of development in the Ka'u district and joined with others last year in sponsoring Mainland newspaper advertisements that said geothermal was ""ugly, toxic. costly and sacrilegious."" The ads urged readers to help prevent the industrialization of Hawaii.
Dedman was identified in news accounts as the spokesman for the fund and shown as its president in the paid advertisements. The ads also contained the names of Molokai physician Emmett Aluli and activist Lehua Lopez.
Dedman and Aluli went to the U.S: Supreme • Court in an attempt to overturn a Hawaii Supreme Court ruling that concluded geothermal development did not infringe on Hawaiians' right to worship Pele. the fire goddess.
The federal district court last year let stand the Hawaii Supreme Court decision.

Geothermal pipe bursts on Big Isle, causing a foul smell By Rod Thompson Big Islond correspondent
PAHOA, Hawaii - Part of the piping at the state's only geother· mal energy plant ripped open yes· terday, causing uncontrolled vent· ing of foul·smelling steam fQr several hours, the Hawaii Electric Light Co. said.
The incident began at the plant 3~~ miles east of Pahoa at about 5:45 a.m .• said HELCO spokesman WIlliam Stormont.
A 4-inch valve blew 011 a flash separator, a device that separates geothermal steam from hot water, he said. Bolts holding the valve in plae£' broke, apparently due to JIlt'tal fatlgut"" C8I1S('d by vibration and corrosion, he said.
By 10 a.m. technicians were able to vent the steam through a rock muffler designed tor such 4!mer· gency use, reducing some of the noise and smell, and by 2 p.m. the plant was operating normally again, Stormont said.
The plant is owned by the state and operated by HELCO. Designed with a capacity of about three megawatts of electricity when it became operational In 198t, its capacity has declined to 2.2 mt'gaw3tts, Stormont ~aid. The plant produced 2.4 percent or the power consumed on the Big Island last year, he said.

Tuesday report
Dedman charged for drugs, rifles A prominent anti-geothermal activist was arrested Saturday and charged yesterday on several drug and firearms violations. Ralph Palikapu Dedman, 42, of Wailau, Ka'u was arrested with two other men by Kona police following a two-month surveillance of a marijuana patch in the Ninol~Wailau area of Ka'u.
Dedman is a spokesman for the Pele Defense Fund aimed at stopping geothermal development on the Big Island.
Police conducted a search of Dedman's residence and reportedly found freshly harvested and dried marijuana, unidentified pills and five rifles. Police also found 320 marijuana plants in fields the men were allegedly tending. .
Dedman, a self-employed fisherman, was charged yesterday with three counts of second-degree promotion of a detrimental drug, one count of third-degree promotion of; a detrimental drug, five counts of being a felon in possession of firt!arms, five counts of failing to register the firearms, and one count of trespassing.
The other men, a 40-year-old Pahala resident and a 42-year-old Volcano resident, were released pending pending further investigation, police said.
Dedman was a co-complainant in an unsuccessful lawsuit that went to the U.S. Supreme Court last year. He and co-complainant Dr. Emmett Aluli of Molokai sought to have the court overturn a Hawaii Supreme Court decision that said geothermal development did not infringe on Hawaiians' right to worship the goddess Pele. The high court let the state decision stand.
Deqman· posted bail totaling $6,925 and was released from jail , last night.

Planners defer geothermal action, mediation suggested By GORDON Y.K. PANG West HawaII Today
HILO - Puna residents concernid about geothermal development in their district got an unexpected lift when county Civil Defense Administrator Harry Kim told the county Planning Commission that a mediator should help resolve the con~of the public .. the mediation, he said ""it is important that the concerns expressed of the proposed sites be thoroughly reviewed at this stage so as to minimize problems, of hopefully, a solid, wellplanned geothermal energy' industry that has taken into account our energy needs of this state, and the residents whose lifestyle will be changed to varying degree.""
The Planning Department is recommending the commission approval the appJication for a geothermal resource permit, although with conditions. .... owing a lengthy meeting, which heard testimony from more than 30 of the jampacked crowd of over 75 boisterous geothermal objectors, the cOmmission chose to continue the hearing, thereby deferring action on the University of HawaWs plan for scientific observation holes (SOHs) pending site observation in Puna.
In all, the university is proposing four SOHs· be drilled at different sites in Puna ""to evaluate the geology, hydrology and subsurface thermal regime"" in the area, according to an environmental assessment done by t...,H Hawaii Natural' Energy l ....... ute. Three of the SOH requests are before the county Planning Commission, the other before the state Land Use Commission because it is on state land.
Kim said the commissioners should be mindful of a ""blow . Qut"" which occurred at a pipe system connected to a Hawaii Geothermal Project Abbott mGPA) exploratory well in 1983.
According to Dr. Harry Olson, the holes are not designed as production wells or to produce nuids, nor would they be now tested or produced.
However, Puna residents testified that geothermal develop-. ment of any kind in their area would bring excessive noise and possibly health consequences.
Kim, a Puna resident himself, safd that while he is a backer or geolhermal development, ""con~rns expressed by the resi~ent:;, !sndowners and businesses in the areas o[ the proposed (SOHs) prompts this request [or mediation. ""
Under mediation,. which would begin 10 days following the close of the public hearing, a mediator selected by the commission would hear the complaints of residents, as well I\S ' the arguments of the university, and try to come to a solution.
Calling for the. county Planning Department to be a part or
o
A break in the pipe system near the Leilani Estates subdivision resulted in ""uncontrollable leakage"" of hydrogen sulfide gas. Civil Defense workers evacuated three families. They stayed in a Hilo hotel until the leak could be repaired.
Kim said danger to residents during that episode were minimal - the odor factor was the most unhealthy thing for residents, and those in the most danger were workers repairing the pipe and exposed directly to
the gas. However, for the sake of public safety, he said, pre-plans for emergency response should . be submitted by the university. Lon Rankin, president of the
Kapoho Community Association, said there are four major subdivisions within a three mile radius of the one of the proposed sons; including about 7.000 lots, 830 homes, 2,000 people and at least 28 agricultural enterprises. .
Among those within a onemile radius are 78 lots, 26 homes, 57 people and 19 agricultural enterprises, Rankin said.
He said during discussions with the county Planning Department and others concerned with the project, the community association ""discov-
ered that they really had no idea how many people lived in the Kapoho area or who we were, or to what extent the area was thriving agriculturally.""
Rankin presented a petition with 200 signatures from people protesting the SOHs.
Teresa Bonahan said she and her husband own an IS-acre citrus and flower farm half a mUe from the so-called SOH 2
""site Rankin cited. Bonahan echoed comments made by others giving testimony.
For one, she said, loud drilling 24 hours a day during development stages would make living
""unbearable"" for residents. In addition. aueeessful drillings at the sons would lead to ""extensive geothermal development"" which would ""blemilh the natural beauty of Kapoho with an industrial eyesore making it unpleasant for thos who live. work and visit the Kapoho area.""
She also said geothermal' development could have an adverse Impact on ground water resources the agricultural nature of Kapoho. ""Surfacing
See GEOTHERMAL P.4A
... geoth~rmal From Page 3A geothermal gases may cause acid rain that will damage crops, flowers and foliage,"" she said. ""This sort of contamination could go undetected until it is made evident through future water well testing. Once the ground water table is contaminated, the damage is irreversible.""
The Planning Department's staff report, in recommending approval, said the project ""would not have unreasonable adverse health, environmental or socioeconomic effect on residents or surrounding property"" and ""would not unreasonably burden public agencies"" to provide _ infrastructural improvements. In addition, the staff believes .. there are reasonable measures to mitigate ... unreasonable adverse effects or burdens.""
The condltionl Imposed by the department include subrnllllon and approval of noise monltoriDl and air quality monitoring plans prior to drilling. The university must also submit a plan of action to deal with emergency situations, which would need approval froin the Civil Defense Agency. '
In addition, the peUtioner must ""publish • telf!phone number for use by local residents in case of noise or odor complaints and have an employee available at the drill site, Sf houri a day t to respond to any local ""COmplaints. ""
Noise Ieveis would need to be kept at 55 decibels cIuriDI dayUght hour8 and 45, decibels at night. .

Puna·folks smell 'geothermal' and don't like it By Rod Thompson Big Island COITespondtnt
HILO - Geothermal by anyother name would stnl steam residents in the Big Island's Puna district.
Hawaii County officials rediscovered that Tuesday when two state agencies asked the county for permission to drill deep. geothermal-like holes, despite an attempt to downplay the use of the word. geothermal.
Four ""scientific observation holes"" is what the Hawaii Natural Energy Institute and the Research Corporation of the University of Hawaii told the county Planning Commission they want.
But farmers and residents in the area and believers in the Ha! waiian volcano goddess Pele objected. And before the matter can be voted on by the commission, it will go through a mediation process called for by county Civil Defense Director Harry Kim.
The program needs county approval to drill three of the holes and state Board of Land and Natural Resources permission for the fourth.
On a H) .. mile stretch of the Puna area. the holes could not be used for geothermal energy production.
But they would be used to gather information to promote geothermal development. said Maurice Kaya. representing the state
Department of Business and EconomiC Development.
The 1988 state Legislature earmarked $3 million for the holes for that purpose, he said.
Commission Chairman Gary Mizuno told an overflow audience of about 60 people in a small confer .. ence room. ""The state's pOSition is to develop geothermal over other uses.""
That set the stage for a clash with the majority of the audience.
Delan ""Rustv"" PerrY told the commission that he haS 75 acres of papayas. bananas and other fruits immediately bordering one of the hole sites. Geothermal develop .. ment would be a ""severe detri .. ment~ to his farmin~. he said.

the Pahoa-Kapoho and Pahoa-Pohoiki roads about 3,000 feet north of the current HGP-A geothermal well in Pohoiki. SOH 2 would be located about 2,200 feet north-northeast of of Halekamahina Crater near' Soga Camp Road. SOH 3 and 4 are planned on Campbell Estate land in a central portion of Kilauea's east rift zone.
The university needs county approval for three of the four holes. The fourth is on land in the state's Conservation District and is under the purview of the state Board of Land and Natural Resources.
Opponents focused on SOH 2 in Kapoho as a source of concern. Lon Rankin, president of the recently formed Kapoho Community Association, told commissioners that there are 838 homes and 2,100 residents within a t111't~e-mile radius of the site, including those in Chow FaI""m Lots, Waa Waa Subdivision, Nunawale Estates and Leilani Estates.
Noting that the subdivisions in the area have the potential of being home to up to 10,000 residents, 'Rankin said, ""proposing to put geothermal development in an area with this much population is completely inappropriate. ""
Rankin submitted a petition signeci by about 200 residents opposed to the drilling program.
Once drilling commences at a site, it is tc:> continue 24 hours a day, with the area lighted at night. The noise, one resident said, would make life in the vicinity of the site ""unbear~ able."" Others among the 40 or so people testifying said they were worried the drilling might lead to contamination of groundwater in the area.
Harry Olson, the university's principal investigator on the project, insisted during his testimony that the SOH program is pl:1rely a .. ~search program. The wells will be neither flow tested nOI' put into production.
he said, adding that there should be no gaseo~s emissions. He said the dd11ing sites will tie returned to their original state after the project is completed.
But opponents. noted that the project is being conducted in cooperation with two private geothermal developers: Puna Geothermal Venture and True/Mid-Pacific Geothermal Venture.
Those testifying against the SOH project argued that the commission should consider the overall impacts of commercial geothermal development and not just the impacts specifically associated with the. resea'rch effort.
They won some support for that position from county Civil Defense Administrator Harry Kim, who urged the panel to ""look upon this application with its total implications on possible geothermal development for the area and not just one of a Scientifc Observation Hole Program.""

Kapoho CODlll1unity Association fig·hting geothern1al developDlent By Dave Horado-Stone T ribune-Hercid
The Kapoho Community Association is urging property owners in lower Puna to withdraw their parcels from state-designated Geothermal Resource subzones.
The zones were designated by the state Board of Land and Natural Resources for the exploration and development of geothermal resources to produce electricity.
There are currently three such subzones on the Big Island. The Kapoho subzone comprIses about 6.800 acres east of Pahoa on both sides of Highway :3!! ::md running from the Lava Tree .,5'ate Park to about a mile mauka of the light-
house at Cape Kumakahi. West of the Kapoho subzone are the the Kamaili subzone. about 5,405 acres in size. and the Kilauea rniddle-east rift subzone, which covers 9,014 acres.
A fourth Geothermal Resource Subzone is located on Haleakala on Maui.
The association is opposed to any geothermal development in the area, arguing the activity will harm crops, reduce property values. contaminate ground water supplies and endanger the health of area residents.
Both state and county officials have supported geothermal energy development as a clean, home-grown alternative to imported oil for power genera-
tion in Hawaii. State and utility planners hope to eventually develop enough of the resource on the Big Island to export up to 500 megawatts of the power to Oahu.
Though a request by individual property owners will have no effect on the right of geothermal developers to drill on land they own or control, KCA Vice President Barbara Bell said the effort is intended to send a message.
""The association believes that if enough property owners withdraw their land from a GRS. there will be a clear message to the state, county and private business that there is a definite
GEOTHERMi\L: Kap()ho group in opposition From Page 1
land-use conflict in some areas. and therefore geothermal development would be inappropriate,"" Bell said.
State regulations allow for the boundaries of a Geothermal Resource Subzone to be modified at the request of owners of property within the subzone. subject to the approval of the state Board of Land and Natural Resources.
The regulation requires that
before granting a request to modify the boundaries of a subzone. the board must find ""by a preponderance of the evidence that the area is no longer suited for (its) designation.""
The regulation adds, howevE!r. that ""within an existing subzone with active· geothermal development activities. the ~rea may not be rr.odified or withdrawn.""
Because tht! Kapoho subzone :~s already the site of some geothermal de','elopme:lt. including the University of Hawaii's experi-
mental HGP-A power plant: the success of the KCA's effort could hinge on the board's interpretation of the regulation.
DLNR geologist Dan Lum said this morning that he is unsure whether the language in the rule is intended to apply only to parcels on which there has been geothermal development. or to all parcels within the zone. He said the matter would likely be referred to state attornevs should it come before the board.
KCA officials hope to combine
individual requests for withdrawals for presentation to the board at one time. ""This will be a much easier process as a group than if (residents) were to do it on their own."" she said.
She is urging interested property owners to call the association at 965-7119 or write to the group at P.O. Box 1371, Pahoa. Hawaii 96778.
Those who want to know whether their property is within a Geothermal Resource Subzone can call the DLNR at 548-7541.

Geothermal energy, cable link sought Five hundred thousand kilowatts of geothermalproduced electricity transmitted by underwater cable from the Big Island to other islands of the state may become a reality by 1995, according to the State of Hawaii and Hawaiian Electric Company.
The State and Heco last month announced plans to seek proposals in early May for a private consortium to finance and develop the Big Island's geothermal energy resource and to transmit that electricity to Oahu, and possibly Maui.
Successful completion of geothermal development and underwater cable transmission would save millions of barrels of fuel oil used to generate electricity on Oahu and would be a giant leap toward meeting the State's goal of becoming energy self-sufficient.
The joint State-Heco request for proposals is being issued this year even though geothermal energy wouldn't be transmitted by 1995 in order to allow Heco to consider other generating alterna-
tives for Oahu if responses to the request for proposals shows geothermal development to be uneconomical.
Selection of a developer-should a proposal prove economical and practical-would take place by the end of 1990.
The total project is estimated to cost more than $1.7 billion.
Researchers have estimated that at least 500,000 kilowatts of geothermal energy resource exists in the subzone of the Kilauea East Rift Zone of the island's Puna District.
Early last year, the Governor's Advisory Committee on the Geothermal/Cable project endorsed geothermal energy as technically feasible.
The State Legislature in 1988 did its part to pave the way for geothermal development by streamlining permitting procedures and funding exploration and reservoir analysis.

Dear Bill:
Thank you for the opportunity to review and comment on the draft administrative rules for Act 301, 1988, regarding Geothermal and Cable System Development Permitting. The rules appear to be clear, well written, reasonable and prudent in the main, however, one sentence relating to the joint agreement, first sentence, last paragraph, page 185-19, is troublesome and may prevent our agency and other federal agencies from signing a joint agreement. That sentence now reads:
""Federal agencies are invited to sign the joint agreement, but once they agree to participate in the consolidated permitting process, they are committed to continue to participate throughout the entire process for each geothermal and cable system development project application submitted to the department"".
That sentence as written appears to require federal agencies to make commitments that they, in fact may not be able to meet. While my agency, NOAA Fisheries, may be able to advise you that we intend to participate throughout the entire permit process we cannot unequivocally assure you that we will have the resources to do so. Also, the permitting process may require several years to complete although the State of Hawaii is doing its very best to foreshorten the time period. Our agency inter alia cannot necessarily make commitments binding on future administrations. Accordingly I suggest that you consider rewriting the sentence to read:
""Federal agencies are invited to sign the joint agreement, for a period not to exceed the term of the entire process for each geothermal and cable system development project application submitted to the department"".
o • I am taking the liberty of forwarding a copy of your request to the Southwest Region, NOAA Fisheries for further review. We will inform you of additional comments, if any, on this matter.
Sincerely yours,
~ates j~~~i~·I~lands Coordinator cc: F/SWR, E.C. Fullerton (w/encl.)

I. Opening Remarks
Mr. Manabu T~gomori opened the meeting at 10:00 a.m. for Mr. William Paty who was unavailable. Mr. Tagomori welcomed the attendees and asked them to introduce themselves. Mr. Tagomori summarized the work done by the group since its first meeting in September 1988. He said that the administrative rules for Act 301 would be going out to the group later in the week, and he requested comments on the rules before the next meeting. He mentioned that staff has now been hired and office space has been secured at the Gcld Bond Building, Room 509. He said that the details on the office would be provided to the members.

Once the holes have reached the reservoir area, geophysical 10qs will be taken to monitor for temperature and pressure. The holes will be monitored for several years or until the holes cave in, at which time they would be abandoned by standard closing procedures. Dr. Olson said that initially he had hoped to start drilling in the spring of 1989, but there may be delays until September 1989.
Or-mat Next, Mr. Tagomori Energy Systems, Inc. called on tCI di SCl.ISS
•
Mr. Maurice Richard of his company's proposals .
o CJ Mr. Richard said that for background, Ormat acquired Puna Geothermal Venture in July 1988. which essentially comprised an Environmental Impact Statement, three wells in Puna, and a lease and energy contract for 25 MW of power. He said that his firm has made efforts to improve the approaches to the project. In December he said he submitted an application to the County of Hawaii. and is new in the process of working out details regarding form. content and wording of the application. In mid December, a plan of operations was submitted to the Department of L..<::~nd and Nab.!"" .... "", I Rest1un::e!'.ii. He sad d an ""author- it Y to c:c::mstrl.l(::t II for the well field and fer the plant would be available within the next two weeks.
Mr. Richard then presented a video tape on Ormat's technology and various successful projects in Utah and Nevada. After the video presentation Mr. Richard presented diagrams of how the technology would be modified for application in Hawaii, using back pressure turbines that work like a windmill, to extract a certain amount of heat, since Hawaii's is one of the hottest geothermal resources in the world.
Several technical questions followed Mr.Richard's presentation. Mr. Kaya asked about differences between Ormat's approach considering information from the existing HGPA plant, and Dr. Olson's research. Mr. Kaya's concern was about injecting brine, which is a different method from that used at HGPA where the liquid is steamed. Mr. Richard said the liquid would be recombined and reinjected.
Someone asked Mr. Richard if his project would have corrosion inhibitors and he answered no. Anoth~r question was what per cent of electricity generated would be from non-turbine methods and what per cent from the regular method. Mr. Richard said they""e would be 10 back pr'eSSLIY""f!:! tur'bin~:~s and 10 ""EDe':;"", which would net 25 MW and gross between 28 and 30 MW of power.
h:i S. ofH.:':'I"" a l: j, Df') st~?i:.""Irn p~""'lr' kw and thf.'~r'E~+Clt-e Mr. Kaya asked Mr. Richard to compare with the steam flash unit which produces 14 Ibs of hour.

He said he is proposing 6 well pads, but it doesn't mean they will all be used.
Next, Mr. Tagomori called on Mr. Rod Moss of True MidPacific Geothermal Venture. He gave a history of his firm's involvement in the geothermal area in Hawaii. He gave a slide presentation on locations and permits. He said his project could commence in four months after the permits are received.
o o
Mr. Kaya asked Mr. Moss how much money his firm must invest before they can actually start selling 25 MW of electricity. Mr. Moss said about $45 million. He said that each well costs about two and a half million dollars, so the expense will be between fourteen and fifteen million dollars just for the wells. Mr. Kaya commented that he just wanted people to be aware of the size of the investment we are talking about in these projects.
Mr. Tagomori brought up the subject of the recent Request for Proposals (RFP) by Hawaiian Electric Company for a combined State and HEeD geothermal and cable project. He called on Mr. Jerry Lesperance to provide some information. Mr. Lesperance said that the goal is 1990 to go ahead with the 500 MW project including the cable. He said the RFP is being developed by the Department of Business and Economic Development and will go out in May 1989. The estimated cost of the project is $1.7 billion.
Mr. Kaya asked about economics of scale, whether more power is better"" for the development companies. Mr. Moss said that because of the economy of scale, it would be better to develop 500 MW. Mr. Richard said that his firm wants to participate in the development of the proposed 500 MW of power, but wants to learn from the installation of the 25 MW plant first.
Mr. Tagomori mentioned the bill before the legislature currently on the geothermal corridor. He said the Department would be monitorinq the status of the bill and would keep the Interagency Group informed.
Ill. Status Report on the Implementation of Act 301
Mr. Tagomori then called on Mr. Dan Lum of the Division of Water and Land Development to update the group on the progress made in implementing Act 301.
Mr. Lum summarized the intent of Act 301, to provide a consolidated permitting process for geothermal and cable projects. He said that the aqencies have cooperated by sendinq in copies of their respective permitting rules ~nd regul~tion. and permit application forms. The 301 staff has had a chance to identify what permits may be required for various projects, and to study and learn the permitting requirements. The administrative rules are in final draft, and will be distributed to the Interagency Group for their review within the week. Staff has been hired, and office space for the 301 process is being prepared for occupancy. Items are being assembled for the information center function of Act 301, and for the repository for all geothermal and cable information.
o o Mr. Tagomori said that a copy of Act 301 will be
included in the mailing with the draft administrative rules. He asked that the agencies send in their comments to the administrative rules draft.
IV. Future Meeting Date
Mr. Tagomori called for the next meeting of the Interagency Group to be held March 14, 1989, at the same time and location.
V. Other Business
Mr. Tagomori called on the various County repr-esentatives to comment on their activities in the area of geothermal permitting. Mr. Ralph Masuda of Maui County said that the draft rules for Geothermal Resource Permits have been prepared, and that there would be a public hearing on the rules at the end of May. He said hopefully the rules would be adopted in July or August.
Mrs. Susan Labrenz, Managing Director of Hawaii County, commented that Hawaii County officials may be perceived to be cautious in the geothermal area, but she said it is because the County wants to do the project right the first time, and is looking for a good track record.
Mr. Jerry Lesperance said there is assessment on the 500 MW cable being reviewed Department of Business and Economic Development, ready for publication in March 1989. an environmental in draft at the and it should be
Mr. Paty returned from hearings at the legislature and urged the group to push on in working out the consolidated permitting process, because all involved are on a tight time schedule. He said it is this group that can make the geothermal project happen, but the timing is very important.
Mr. Tagomori said that the schedule calls for the administrative rules to be ready around the fourth of July. He col sed the meeting on that note, andn with a reminder that the next meeting will be on March 14, 1989, same time of day and the same location.

Draft Minutes Interagency Group for Geothermal/Cable Permitting
I. Opening Remarks
September 29, 1988 10:00 a.m. 1151 Punchbowl Street Honolulu, Hawaii 96813
Mr. Paty opened the meeting, putting the geothermal project into perspective as the largest project the State has ever contemplated doing, and as such, requiring some forty or more permits. He said that Act 301 was established to assist in coordinating the permitting effort so that potential developers can be assured that not only is there a resource to develop, but also that they will be getting some assistance in the permitting area, so as to minimize unanticipated delays.
II. Introduction of Members
Mr. Paty had the Interagency Group members introduce themselves and identify which agency they represented.
III. Report on the State's Energy Program - Department of Business ad Economic Development
Mr. Paty called on Mr. Gerald Lesperance for an update on the geothermal program. Mr. Lesperance called on his boss Mr. Tom O'Brien who gave an introduction to the Energy Division program. He said that the program is based on the Hawaii State Plan and the Energy Functional Plan which call for providing dependable economical statewide energy capable of supporting the needs of the people, and for achieving increased energy self sufficiency. Geothermal energy is the component of the State energy program that is Hawaii's best base load source of energy, so this is the component that the program is concentrating on.
Mr. Lesperance gave a presentation that included information on electricity production for 1987. Oahu, Maui, Big Island and Kauai produce relative amounts of electricity in that respective order. In terms of energy source, oil is by far the greatest source. This is of concern because the state is 90% dependent on foreign oil, and also because the price of oil is
o o expected to increase drastically during the next decade. The geothermal resource is the only large scale indigenous resource whose conversion to base load electricity is commercially mature. Next, Mr. Lesperance then discussed the location of the geothermal resource. He said that there is a low probability of a high temperature resource on Maui, but on the Big Island there is a 90% probability of drilling a hole and hitting extremely high temperatures, particularly in the Kilauea east rift zone and the Kilauea south rift zone. There are estimates that the electricity needs of the entire State of Hawaii could be met for the next century using the resource of the east rift zone. That is just someone's estimate, but the State's goal is to supply roughly half of the State's electricty from the geothermal resource. This is so that no one resource is the sole resource that is depended on - it is better to spread the dependency. Mr. Lespearnce then spoke about the history of geothermal development in Hawaii. He said that there was some shallow exploration for geothermal resources in the 60's. In 1976 the University of Hawaii started developing the HGPA plant. In 1981 the plant was generating three MW of power. During the period 1980 to 1985, six private wells were drilled. Three wells did not produce; three did. In 1983 the legislature passed legislation providing for a geothermal resource subzones assessment and designation. Three geothermal resource sub zones were designated on the Big Island and one on Maui in the Haleakala soutwest rift zone. Mr. Lesperance said that at present there are two developers, True/ Mid-Pacific Geothermal Venture and Ormat Energy Systems, Inc. Ormat (Puna Geothermal Venture) plans to be able to be able to make 12 1/2 MW of electricity available to HELCO by 1991. Next, Mr. Lesperance reported that the Department of Business and Economic Development is conducting an environmental assessment to be published by the end of the year. It is DBED's own project, not a requirement of the environmental statutes, but one a project that the agency is conducting to assess for itself the impact of developing 500 MW of power in the Kilauea east rift zone. Mr. Lesperance presented a chart showing a scenario of a number of 50 MW plants. This would be the average plant size. About 125-150 wells would be required to produce 500 MW of electricity, including a percentage of wells that would be injection wells, wells drilled for the purpose of reinjecting the geothermal liquids back into the ground at depth. Mr. Lesperance said this is the way it is done in other geothermal plants in other parts of the world - Northern California, Italy, Iceland, and New Zealand. He went on to discuss the environmental issues associated with geothermal development. Issues he cited are noise, especially during open venting, air quality, erosion, visual intrusion. Next Mr. Lesperance discussed the path of the cable required to bring electricity to Oahu. The cable would go from the Puna geothermal fields overland towards Hilo and then either through the Saddle Road area or over north of Mauna Kea, and then into the ocean, through the Alenuihaha Channel at depths exceeding 6,500 feet. The cable will be trenched as it passes through the land/ocean interface and some distance out into the ocean, to a depth of 100 feet or so. For the most part the cable
o o will lie on the ocean bottom. The cable will be aluminum, and will carry DC current. It weighs 22 pounds per lineal foot out of water, 20 pounds per lineal foot in water. Mr. Lesperance said the ongoing geothermal program has been a combined federal/state effort, with 22 million dollars in federal U.S. Department of Energy money and 44 million State of Hawaii money. As far as impacts on the environment, the cable will have the usual temporary impacts during construction, there will be some biota interference both on land and in the ocean; overland portions of the cable will be supported either on solid poles or on lattice towers. This will involve some disruption of the soil and potential for erosion, as well as visual intrusion. One concern is the health issue of living in close proximity to a high voltage AC cable. Mr. Lesperance said that there is a consideration that health impacts are lessened if the cable is DC rather than AC. As to cost of the system, Mr. Lesperance said that to develop 500 MW of power, the wells and the steam field would cost something over half a billion dollars, and the cable with rectifiers and including the land portion, and with the conversion from AC to DC and back to AC, about a half a billion, for a total, of 1.5 billion. The hope is that this will be private dollars, with some assistance from the State. Mr. Lesperance went on to introducing the former Governor Bill Quinn. He said that Mr. Quinn chairs the Governor's Advisory Board on the Geothermal/Cable Project. This board determined that the geothermal and cable aspects of the project are inseperable, and so when we discuss the geothermal project we must include the cable as an integral portion of that project. It was Mr. Qquinn's board that was responsible for introducing the bill that became Act 301. Mr. Lesperance said that the 25MW project is scheduled to be completed by 1991; HECO hopes to be accepting electricity from the 500 MW project from the Big Island in 1995. But it may take up to ten years to get the full 500 MW available and the cables, each capable of sustaining 250 MW, the third is a spare for redundancy. Finally Mr. Lesperance referred to a library of some 480 titles, with the titles on computer. He offered the use of this data base to anyone interested. In conclusion, Mr. Lesperance quoted from Governor John Waihee's statement from a letter he wrote to the Public Utilities Commission: ""I am committed to the development of Hawaii's indigenous energy resources to reduce dependence on foreign petroleum. At the present time geothermal is the primary viable indigenous energy resource for the State. This administration must support the development of geothermal energy and use all means to get the job done.
Next, Mr. Paty called on Mr. Clyde Nakata representing the Utilities. Mr. Nakata explained that the project he is discussing is the 25MW project, which is entirely separate from the 500 MW prject, since it is only for Big Island. Mr. Nakata explained that in March 1986 the utility had signed a purchase power contract with Thermal Power Company to supply energy to HELCO, 12 1/2 MW in 1989 and another 12 1/2 MW in the 1991-1993 time frame. Mr. Tanigawa, project engineer, explained using
o o maps, how his company proposed power plant areas. The utility brought in an environmental planning firm to find the areas in which the transmission lines would be a least constraint, where they would have the least amount of adverse effect. After they idenified these areas, they were to find two alignments within the corridors, meaning the exact location where the pole line should be installed. Also they were asked to look at three different methods of transmission - traditional overhead lines, an underground line, and submarine cable. They found that overhead transmission line was the best method in their broad scale analysis.
The route would be from the Pohoiki site to the Puna switching station. In the broad scale analysis the consultants looked at exclusionary areas, soil conditions, geologic hazards, biological factors, socioeconomic factors, recreation sites, land use, land ownership, land regulations, and cost factors, which included land values, maintenance costs, and accessibility to the transmission line sites. After the consultants had identified three corridors, they did a more in depth study. They sent various scientists, including archaeologists, botanists, entymologists, geologists, and landscape specialists to look at the three corridors. Their job was to identify any further constraints within these corridors, in order to come up with the final alignment, the one with the fewest constraints. At this point, Mr. Nakata introduced Mr. Dennis Tanigawa who explained from a map the exact alignment that was proposed from the various studies. Mr. Tanigawa pointed out the exact location within the Pohoiki area where the Ormat geothermal plant is proposed, and then he pointed out the Puna substation in Keaau where the transmission lines would lead. Mr. Tanigawa said they tried as much as possible to stay out of subdivisions, and when they had to cross them they did so in the least populated areas. Mr. Nakata added that they also tried as much as possible to minimize the visual impact of the lines by running them closer to areas that had vegetation that would screen them from view. But the major consideration was to stay out of subdivisions as much as possible. He pointed out from the map that where they did go through subdivisions there was no choice because the subdivision goes all the way from Highway 130 to the ocean and from Highway 130 to the volcano area. He also said that this is not necessarily the route that will ultimately be taken. This is the consultant's recommendation, but the utility will be doing further analysis and making adjustments as necessary. Mr. Nakata said the utility had had a number of meetings with public agencies and with public associations and community members. He said that informational workshops have also been held regarding some of the community concerns, among them health concerns and property values. Mr. Nakata said that the utility had contacted the real property tax office in Hilo and""had found out that property values had not been affected by the installation of a transmission line elsewhere in Hilo in 1974. Also, in the area of health and safety, Mr. Nakata said that the transmission lines would be protected by relay devices which
o o would de-energize the circuit as soon as a fault is detected. Other concerns Mr. Nakata addressed were TV and radio interference. He said that if it's cable there should be no problem; if it is over the air type of reception like radio, there are times in which through wind some of the connectors may get a little loose, and there may be some interference, but, he said, as long as the utility is notified, they can send their technicians out to identify the problem and locate and correct it or change the hardware. As far as visual intrusion is concerned, which is another concern, an effort has been made to use natural landscape as much as possible to mitigate the visual intrusion. As far as concern over transmission loads is concerned, Mr. Nakata said he stressed to the public that these lines are only for the 25 MW project, they are 69 KV lines, not the type that would be used for the 500 MW project. The 69 KV lines do not have the capacity to handle 500 MW, so these lines are not intended for bulk transmission of power. Finally, Mr. Nakata gave a summary of where the utility is on the 25MW project. He said the routing study just reported on has been completed and transmitted to various agencies. He said they are working on the EIS portion of the study now, and Ormat Energy Systems has taken over the project. He said that basically the utility end of the project was on hold for some time, from August 1987, because of the pending sale from Thermal Power Company to other companies. There was no commitment as to whether they were going to continue or not. Now that Ormat has taken over, the utility is meeting with them to finalize contracts and schedules. On the alignment, the utility is working to finalize it. He said that one of the suggested alignments is using Highway 130. He said the utility is working with the telephone company and the State of Hawaii to utilize the right of ways on the highway. He said the utility needs their okays. He said they need to submit design drawings, which has already been done to Department of Transportation, and as yet there has been no feedback. He stated that HELCO does need the power since continued high growth is anticipated in the east and west Hawaii areas. In that regard he mentioned that anticipated peak demand is the reason why the utility will be going ahead with installing a combustion turbine on the Big Island next year.
Mr. Paty thanked Mr. Nakata for his presentation, and called on former Governor William Quinn to say a few words.
Governor Quinn spoke about the Governor's Advisory Board on Geothermal/Cable Development of which he serves as Chair. He said that the Advisory Board was named in August 1987. Mr. Paty is on the Board, Roger Ulveling, Mayor Carpenter, and a small but distinguished group of business and labor people. Governor Quinn reiterated that the Board quickly reported to the Governor that the cable couldn't be separated from the rest of the geothermal project, and so those two have been combined in everyone's thinking since then. He reported that the Advisory Board met with five cable developers from Norway, Sweden, France, Italy and Japan, all of whom felt the project was feasible. But, he said,
o they were all concerned with permits. He said that as the Board and DB ED looked at it, they found there were forty some permits, which is intimidating, and which is the reason the Board felt a single permitting process would be better than repeating over and over similar presentations and requests but in slightly differing formats for forty or more authorizing agencies. He said that every aspect of the project would be scrutinized and laid before the public, but in a coordinated fashion, through a lead agency, to coordinate State and County permitting, and hopefully with the federal agencies cooperating on a voluntary basis. He said that Hawaiian Electric Company is under a time constraint because they believe that they must know by mid 1990 whether there is going to be a geotherrmal resource available to them to provide power to Oahu. He said that during the past week the Board at Hawaiian Electric's urging decided that Hawaiian Electric ought to go forward with developing a request for proposals, put it out, in the name of the State of Hawaii, to show the State's support for the project, and by the time the private company or consortium came in, the permitting process would also start. Governor Quinn said that might be as early as eight months from the present time. He said he was very pleased to see everyone participating in the meeting to see whether it's possible to do this with everyone cooperating in a one-time permit situation.
IV. Report on DLNR's Geothermal Activities
Next Mr. Paty called on Mr. Dan Lum of the Division of Water and Land Development to give a presentation on the various subzones.
Mr. Lum said he would highlight the department's activities in a summary fashion since much had already been covered by Mr. Lesperance in his talk. He said that the department had created the ad hoc geothermal technical advisory committee which identified the potential geothermal areas in the State. The Puna rift zone is the area determined to have a very high potential of geothermal resource, with a 90% or better probability. Mr. Lum pointed to other areas on the map with varying percentages of likelihood for geothermal resource. He said that in July 1976 the first well was put in by the University of Hawaii. This well is known as the HGPA well. Subsequent to 1976 the Legislature had amended the statute governing mineral disposition within the state by defining a mineral to include geothermal energy, and based on that amendment to the statute the department wrote administrative rules governing the leasing of the geothermal resource and the drilling of geothermal wells. In 1979 the department issued its first geothermal lease to the natural energy laboratory of Hawaii for the HGPA well. In 1981 the department issued the next lease, R2, to Kapoho Land Partnership. Also in 1981 the department issued another lease, R3, to Barnwell Drilling Company and in 1982 they issued another lease, R4, to Kapoho Land Partnership. In 1987 the department issued a geothermal mining lease to Campbell
o Estate for approximately 9,000 acres. During the early 1980's the legislature passed legislation giving authority to the Board of Land and Natural Resources to designate subzones throughout the State wherein geothermal exploration and development activities could occur. In August 1984 the department promulgated rules under that legislation governing subzone designation. Mr. Lum pointed out the subzones on the map - the Kapoho subzone, 5,700 acres; the Kamaili subzone; Haleakala subzone; and the Kilauea southwest rift zone that is pending designation depending on a requested contested case hearing. Mr. Lum went on to describe the geothermal wells that have been drilled in the area. They are the HGPA first discovery well, three wells by Puna Geothermal Venture, known as Kapoho State 1, Kapoho State lA, and Kapoho State 2. Mr. Lum pointed out on the map which wells found geothermal resource below 4,000 feet. He said Barnwell Geothermal Company drilled two wells, Lanipuna 1 and Lanipuna 6, both of which found geothermal heat below 4,000 feet, but they would not flash. That is, they tried to unload the water column to release the pressure, but the wells did not flash for some reason. They drilled a third well known as Ashida 1 which likewise found temperature but would not flash. These wells are all capped at present. Barnwell's final attempt was to drill a directional hole, but it did not work. Two other wells were drilled on the western slopes of Punalai which were known as Punawaa wells F and B number 1, and F and B number 2. Neither of these found geothermal resource. Current activities on file in the department include Ormat Energy company of Nevada's take over of Puna Geothermal Venture which originally consisted of Thermal Power Company, Dillingham and Amfac. Ormat Energy company now has controlling interest in that operation, and of the 25 MW facility that is now being proposed. They have Puna Geothermal Venture which currently has Kapoho State 1 and Kapoho State 2 plugged. They have a permit to plug Kapoho State lA, they also hold a permit to drill a directional hole at Kapoho State 2 in an attempt to increase the yield there. Now that Ormat Energy company has taken over Puna Geothermal Venture, our understanding is that they are requesting an extension of the permit to make a directional hole out of Kapoho State 2 and we understand they are planning to submit a plan of operations as required under the State lease process. Also True Mid-Pacific Geothermal company has obtained all the necessary permits to CDUA and they have indicated to the department that they do not plan to begin exploratory drilling until the legal question concerning their parcel is clarified or answered. Barnwell Geothermal Company to our best knowledge has ceased all geothermal exploration activities. Pending regulatory activities by the department at the present time the legislature has passed amendments to existing statutes calling for the revision of the leasing and regulation of geothermal resources. We have legislation passed calling for the amendment of the administrative rules for subzone designation. The amendment is to clarify within a geothermal resource subzone direct use applications. Direct use means using the resource directly such as for drying of foodstuffs. The amendment would clarify that this is an acceptable use within
o the geothermal resource subzones. Currently Mr. Lum said the department has an application pending to designate a sliver of land of about 40 acres as a geothermal resource subzone. The intent there is to use that area for direct use applications of the geothermal resource, presumably from the existing wells.
Mr. Paty thanked Mr. Lum for his presentation and asked if anyone had any questions up to this point. Someone asked if the successful holes are in such a small area, could it be that this is the exception rather than the rule. He said he could see that enough for 25 MW is there, but to develop 500 MW there needs to be evidence of a lot more resource.
Mr. Lesperance responded that the Department of Planning and Business Development had recently had $3 million dollars appropriated to it by the legislature in the 1988 session to stimulate the private sector through exploration and resource assessment. He said the DBED is working with the University on a plan to look at areas other than where holes have been drilled so far to get a start on exploration. Also we know that True Mid-Pacific is just waiting for that legal action to be clarified so that it can bring in a rig and start drilling holes in the western most rift zone.
Mr. Lum said he thinks the answer is that more drilling has to be done.
Next, Mr. Paty called on Mr. Roger Evans who heads the Conservation District Use Application process. Mr. Evans said that his office will come into the process any time a Conservation District Use Permit is required. A conservation district permit could be expected to come in if any part of the proposed project was located in the conservation district. If it's located on land close to where the previous geothermal development took place he said it could be expected to come in; also it could be expected to come in by way of being on the submerged floor of the ocean. So at some point this office could expect to become involved. When the application comes in, Mr. Evans said his office will make two basic assumptions, one, based on our past experience, that as a part of the conservation process, there will be a request for a contested case. The other assumption that will be made is that not withstanding any decision, the probability would be high that it will be in court. On the issues, Mr. Evans said that some of the kinds of issues that you can expect are for example, from one of the earlier applications where the estate of James Campbell applied to the Board on March 2, 1982 for a conservation application to explore and develop at Kohaalea. At the request of various individuals in the vicinity who would be affected by the proposal, the Board conducted a three week contested case hearing. The final argument was made on February 10, 1983. That was a period of 11 months. The hearing itself required 17 days, there were more than 45 witnesses and over 300 exhibits were introduced. The transcript of the hearing exceeds 4,200 pages. That particular
o o hearing was for the exploration and development of the Campbell project. But this kind of process may be expected for the cable also. In terms of the kinds of issues presented to the Board, Mr. Evans said there were two types of issues, procedural and substantive. END OF TAPE ONE The substantive issue include issues such as the hydrogen sulfide issue - the gas that smells like rotten eggs. There are other issues such as soil, geology, the methods that were used to derive wind conditions, the climatology, the noise quality, and the various types of noises - ambient noise, drilling noise, venting noise, power plant noise - the impacts on flora, data that was presented on the flora, the impacts on fauna, the cultural quality, the archaeology, social quality and economics, to name a few. About 160 different issues came before the Board. What happens in a contested case hearing, Mr. Evans said, is that the role of the Board changes and they become much morea quasi-judicial body in that people become parties and the parties call witnesses, and the witnesses present evidence, and one party cross examines that party's evidence or that party's statement, and it becomes much more a trial-like setting. In terms of the staff, the staff role changes, so that we become, if you will, helpers to the Board in carrying out their job. It is the Board that develops the findings of facts and conclusions of law, and it is the Board who then based upon that issues its decision and order. Mr. Evans repeated that when a geothermal project CDUA is filed, one should expect at least in the order of what transpired in the past, something comparable in terms of time and process.
V. Discussion of Act 301, SLH 1988
Next Mr. Paty called on Mr. Susumu Ono to discuss Act 301. He said Act 301 is the reason why we are all here, to try to expedite our permitting efforts.
Mr. Ono asked if he could find out before getting into a discussion of Act 301 what is the status of the suit that has been filed against the Land Board. An attorney from the Office of the Attorney General answered that the latest case in federal court involves a claim by people who had previously unsuccessfully sued in State court to negate a land exchange between the Department of Land and Natural Resources and the Campbell Estate. That litigation went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court and lost. So now they are in federal court claiming that the land exchange violates their civil rights in some unspecified fashion. The spokesperson said that the status of that case is that the Office of the Attorney General is presently revising the draft motion to dismiss the case. It was felt that there is good grounds to dismiss it the case since the plaintiffs were also plaintiffs in the State litigation and most of the issues should have or in fact were litigated in the State court forum, so he said, his office would be filing as soon as all the studies and research are in. He said the office does not want to go to trial on it, but is planning to file a motion prior to the trial setting date.
o o
Mr. Ono went over the legislation that created the Interagency Group. He referred to a flow chart that was handed out that provides the crux of the procedure for 301. He said that all of the agencies represented need to do certain things, and DLNR has some added responsibilities, which shows up in the tentative work plan.
VI. Discussion of Tentative Interagency Group's Work Plan
Mr. Ono referred to the tentative work plan handout which would affect all of the agencies represented. Item number one is to identify what permits are required for a geothermal project. Mr. Ono stressed that this means permits in a very broad sense, because anything that requires a governmental action requires a ""permit"" in terms of Act 301. He said it is not a limited definition. So he asked that if a representative feels that his or her particular agency may require some kind of action in regard to a geothermal project, to please identify those actions or permits and letthe department know. He said there would be some kind of reporting deadline. Also, he said that if Act 301 did impact an agency and it does require some changes in the procedures, forms, rules, the department needs to know about that. He went on to say that if the representative things that the impact upon their agency is such that it is going to pose a legal problem, the department needs to know because the department may have to go back and consider having that portion amended by the legislature. On item number four, Mr. Ono said that if anyone present knows of any agency that is not represented on the Interagency Group but that should be, even if there's a remote possibility that it should be, then the department should be informed. Mr. Ono said that for item number five, DLNR has the responsibility of setting up a repository, so the department will need from each of the agencies one set of forms, instructions, rules, whatever the agency uses that ties into a permitting process. In summary he said items one through five apply to all agencies. However, for the federal agencies, if they have some problems complying because of their procedures or because of the fact that they don't have to participate in this consolidated review process, they can qualify their portion and submit something or say they are not submitting because of whatever reason, the department will understand; but county and State agencies should complete items one through five by November 30, 1988.
Someone asked about which agencies are on the Interagency Group. Mr. Ono said the list includes federal, county, and State agencies that have permit requirements. He said that there are fifty something, perhaps forty some odd permits. He said the department is going to need the help of those agencie to get a complete listing developed.
Mr. Ono went on to say that items six through fourteen will be DLNR's responsibility - to identify its particular role
o o and function to comply with all of the provisions of Act 301, to develop a process to resolve conflicts between and among agencies. He said that the department may run across some very sensitive areas, but will have to proceed anyway and come up with a resolution. Mr. Ono said he felt that with enough discussion conflicts could be worked out as they arise. He said the Act also calls for a consolidated application form, and a rule of operation, a rule of conduct for the Interagency Group, which the Act calls a joint agreement. Also the Act calls for a monitoring procedure to oversee the applicant's work after the permits are issued. In this area DLNR would work through the particular agency issuing the permit, relying heavily on that agency to determine if the applicant is or is not complying with all of the terms and conditions that were part of that particular permit. The Act says each agency will continue to issue its own permits, but provides two instances where functions will be transferred to the Land Board. These are the Land Use Commission functions and some parts of the Harbors responsibilities, including the monitoring aspects. So that except for those two instances, DLNR will have to work through the issuing agency. The Act also calls for the establishment of a permit information and coordination center. This is really to help an applicant or a prospective applicant to come in and get all of the information that would be available. And the repository would have to be kept current. The final item pertains to the usual administrative duties to be performed by DLNR.
Someone from the City and County of Honolulu expressed that it is not clear exactly what the extent of development on land on Oahu will be. So it is hard to say what permits would come into play.
Mr. Ono said it is hard at this point in time to visualize what kinds of permits or which agencies would be involved, but he stressed that if an agency representative thinks there is even the slightest possibility that his or her agency may get involved, then that should be included as a possibility. He said that one must imagine the transmission lines coming in off Waimanalo and overland, andn think of what that might do, and what kind of permits would normally be required by the City for such a thing. Even if there isi a remote possibility, it is safer t
list the permit and include it, as it may become part of the process
VII. Discussion of Future Meeting Date
Mr. Paty asked if there were any more questions or comments. He did not have a definite date for the next meeting but suggested mid November, and suggested the group might want to look to someone to serve as vice Chairman.
Someone asked Mr. Lesperance how many injection wells will be created. He said he thought the figure was one for every three or four production wells.
o o
One of the developers responded that that is the correct ratio. There would be about 25 injection wells for 100 production wells. He went on to say that that is pulling numbers out of the air, but that's the best guess that can be made at the moment. He said we have to make sure we have enough resources to do the job.
Mr. Paty said the group is looking at 12 1/2 MW or 25 MW to move into the HELeO grid on the Big Island, and get our feet wet with that, but we've got a larger job after that.
Mr. Ono suggested that if anyone has any questions to please call 548-7523 or 548-7539 and the department will follow up on those questions right away. He also said he would be glad to sit down separately with any agency on any aspect of the Act or the 301 process.
Mr. Paty thanked everyone for coming out to participatte in this very major effort on the part of everybody in the State. He said he hoped in due course it can be brought to a successful conclusion.

Base Needs for Geothermal Permit Computer Systems
I have checked with various agencies regarding matching equipment with possible data base needs for the repository and information functions of the geothermal permit center, including the State Library, DBED Library, the University of Hawaii Library, Hawaii Institute of Geophysics Library and others. The individuals I spoke with told me that any of the well known brands of computer would be able to hook up with data bases by means of a modem. As to using the DBED geothermal collection, a program called ASK SAM, available for $265.95 from Software Library, can accept data from DBASE 111+ and is said to be a better program for building a textural data base.
The computers recommended wer'e Apple, IBM and Wang. Of those, many prefer IBM, because ther'e is more software available and more training available for the IBM. All but the Apple are on the State bid list. However, the prices for the IBM have expired and have not as yet been renewed, per B & F.
One of the computer people I spoke with recommended getting the IBM System Two Model 30 slightly upgraded model. Budget and Finance also recommended against the IBM system two model 30 that is on the bid list. That one costs about $1500; I called Microage Computer store to get prices to lease or buy two IBM System Two upgraded model 30's with color monitors, one Proprinter III and one HP Laser Printer, cables, modem and external disk drive. The total to purchase is app~oximate] $10,000; the lease price is about $500 per month. Since leasing over two years would be more costly than put-chaSing! and the computer is likely to be usable for more than two years, it would probably be wiser in this case to purchase the equipment.
Dave Wharton of DLNR recommends the Wang Model 280 because it is IBM compatable and therefore can use all the IBM software, is expandable for additional uses later, and it also can access the State's network. Dave says he has had no mechanical problems with his Wang, whereas others In the Department have had a lot of trouble with their IBMs. I had two years experience managing an office that purchased about $70,000 of IBM equipment, and there was a considerable number of equipment failures,
- 1 -

Subject: Meeting February 22, 1989 with Roger Evans
Dean Nakano and I met with Roger Evans regarding questions about True Mid Pacific's request to modify the Board's D~O and whether or not or how that would affect processing Harry Olson's slim holes project. The question put to Roger was does the fact that True Mid Pacific is requesting a modification to the D ~ 0 mean that their CDUA permit cannot be used by Harry's project until the modification request is resolved.
Dean and I summarized for Roger the changes True Mid Pacific is requesting and referencing in their Plan of Operations, to the D~O for their CDUA permit. Roger said in his opinion these are changes that only the Board can authorize. He said it is a question of process - the D~O was made through a process. Any changes to it must be made through the same process. It is not the same as getting a ministerial ok to a plan of operation that follows the D ~ o.
On the question of another project using the same CDUA, Roger said the permit goes with the land, not with the individual. Therefore anyone can use the CDUA as long as they have the OK of the land owner or lessee and as long as they abide by the D~O. That means that the slim holes project does not have to get a new CDUA. However, it does have to abide by the terms of the original D~O.
Dean and I understood from our meeting with Roger that Harry would need a drilling permit, a letter to the Chairman from Campbell approving Olson's attivity on their permitted area, and a letter to the Chairman from Harry providing details on what he proposes to do and how he will meet the conditions of the D&O to Campbell's CDUA permit.

Subject: Meeting with DBED and Harry Olson
Dean and I met with Harry Olson, Maurice Kaya, William Bonnet, Don Thomas, Art Seki, Jerry Lesperance and Marilyn Metz at the Energy Conference Room at 335 Merchant Street at 3:00 p.m. 2/21/89 regarding Harry Olson's slim holes project.
DBED has hired consultant Marilyn Metz to assist Harry Olson prepare the materials required to allow the slim holes project to proceed. The first topic discussed was the Environmental Assessment. Marilyn Metz explained that whenever state lands or state funds are involved there is an agency action and an environmental assessment is required. For the three holes in Hawaii County she said the University of Hawaii would be the proposing agency. The negative declaration will be done by the proposing agency. Marilyn said she would draft the letters required to secure Harry permission to sign, and that she would prepare the documents so that there would be no problem getting the negative declaration. She plans to file with the OEQC on March 16, 1989.
Discussion followed on what other documentation Harry would need. Dean explained that in order to use Campbell's CDUA Harry would need a letter from Campbell acknowledging their ok for use of their land for Harry's purpose. Further, Harry would need a letter describing in some detail the scope of activity and asking the Chairman's ok to use the CDUA permitted area. This would require no board action because the permit is already in place. However, the letter should be as detailed as possible. Further, Harry should explain how he proposes to meet the requirements of the 0 L 0 to the CDUA. The question was discussed as to how True Mid Pacific's requested changes to the 0 L 0 could hold up Harry's plan because Harry was counting on using their access road for access. The access road is part of True's plan of operation which will be held back until the D & 0 requested changes are resolved, which will require Board action.
Marilyn Metz said she would get a copy of the D&O and itemize how Harry's project would meet each of the conditions, or explain why the condition was not applicable to this research type project.
,ro/? It was not clear how the question of development of an ~ss road would be resolved. J
o o
Marilyn said she would have all the documents prepared by February 27, 1989.
There was discussion on the March 7, 1989 Hawaii County Planning Committee meeting. If the outcome of this meeting is positive, and if there is no problem about the environmental assessment and negative declaration which could be in place 60 days after March 16, the slim holes project could be underway for the holes under Hawaii County permitting jurisdiction by May 22, 1989.

Interagency Group on Geothermal and Cable Development
Draft Minutes
Second Meeting, February 14, 1989 Department of Land and Natural Resources
Board Room 1151 Punchbowl Street Honolulu, Hawaii 96813 10:00 a.m.
I. Opening Remarks
Mr. Manabu Tagomori opened the meeting at 10:00 a.m. for Mr. William Paty who was unavailable. Mr. Tagomori welcomed the attendees and asked them to introduce themselves. Mr. Tagomori summarized the work done by the group since its first meeting in September 1988. He said that the administrative rules for Act 301 would be going out to the group later in the week, and he requested comments on the rules before the next meeting. He mentioned that staff has now been hired and office space has been secured at the Gold Bond Building, Room 509. He said that the details on the office would be provided to the m~mbers.
II. Presentation on Current Geothermal Activities in Hawaii
Natural project.
Mr. Tagomori called on Dr. Harry Olson of Energy Institute for a presentation on the
the Hawaii slim holes
Dr. Olson indicated on a map the 6 experimental drilling sites for which his agency is currently seeking permits. Four holes are on the island of Hawaii, two are on the island of Maui. Dr. Olson said that the application for a Geothermal Resource Permit has been submitted to the County of Hawaii, and that there is a hearing scheduled for March 7, 1989 to consider that permit application.
Dr. Olson described the observation holes that his application proposes. There would be various size holes to various depths, using rigs with cores of different si2es and materials, until a depth of about 4,000 feet, more or less, is reached. That is the average depth for reaching the top of a reservoir area. Once the holes have reached the reservoir area, geophysical logs will be taken to monitor for temperature and pressure. The holes will be monitored for several years or until the holes cave in, at which time they would be abandoned by standard closing procedures. Dr. Olson said that initially he had hoped to start drilling in the spring of 1989, but there may be delays until September 1989.
Ormat Next, Mr. Tagomori called on. Mr. Maurice Richard of Energy Systems, Inc. to discuss his company's proposals.
o o
Mr. Richard said that for background, Ormat acquired Puna Geothermal Venture in July 1988, which essentially comprised an Environmental Impact Statement, three wells in Puna, and a lease and energy contract for 25 MW of power. He said that his firm has made efforts to improve the approaches to the project. In December he said he submitted an application to the County of Hawaii, and is now in the process of working out details regarding form, content and wording of the application. In mid December, a plan of operations was submitted to the Department of Land and Natur""al Resources. He said an ""authority to com:;truct"" for the well field and for the plant would be available within the ne~t two weeks.
Mr. Richard then presented a video tape on Ormat's technology and various successful projects in Utah and Nevada. After the video presentation Mr. Richard presented diagrams of how the technology would be modified for application in Hawaii, using back pressure turbines that work like a windmill, to extract a certain amount of heat, since Hawaii's is one of the hottest geothermal resources in the world.
Several technical ~uestions followed Mr.Richard's presentation. Mr. Kaya asked about differences between Ormat's approach considering information from the existing HGPA plant, and Dr. Olson's research. Mr. Kaya's concern was about injecting brine, which is a different method from that used at HGPA where the liquid is steamed. Mr. Richard said the liquid would be recombined and reinjected.
Someone asked Mr. Richard if his project would have corrosion inhibitors and he answered no. Another question was what per cent of electricity generated would be from non-turbine methods and what per cent from the regular method. Mr. Richard said there would be 10 back pressure turbines and 10 IEOC's"", which would net 25 MW and gross between 28 and 30 MW of power.
Mr. Kaya asked Mr. Richard to compare his operation with the steam flash unit which produces 14 lbs of steam per kw hour. Mr. Richard said there would be air cooling and therefore there would be no plume like that produced by the HGPA plant.
Mr. Tagomori asked if Mr. Richard's plan calls for using any of the Kapoho holes. Mr. Richard said they are looking at KS2 and think they can recover KS2. He added that usually the least productive well is your injection well. He said he is proposing 6 well pads, but it doesn't mean they will all be used.
Next, Mr. Tagomori called on Mr. Rod Moss of True MidPacific Geothermal Venture. He gave a history of his firm's involvement in the geothermal area in Hawaii. He gave a slide presentation on locations and permits. He said his project could commence in four months after the permits are received.
J • o o
Mr. Kaya asked Mr. Moss how much money his firm must invest before they can actually start selling 25 MW of electricity. Mr. Moss said about $45 million. He said that each well costs about two and a half million dollars, so the expense will be between fourteen and fifteen million dollars just for the wells. Mr. Kaya commented that he just wanted people to be aware of the size of the investment we are talking about in these projects.
Mr. Tagomori brought up the subject of the recent Request for Proposals (RFP) by Hawaiian Electric Company for a combined State and HEeD geothermal and cable project. He called on Mr. Jerry Lesperance to provide some information. Mr. Lesperance said that the goal is 1990 to go ahead with the 500 MW project including the cable. He said the RFP is being developed by the Department of Business and Economic Development and will go out in May 1989. The estimated cost of the project is $1.7 billion.
Mr. Kaya asked about economics of scale, whether more power is better for the development companies. Mr. Moss said that because of the economy of scale, it would be better to develop 500 MW. Mr. Richard said that his firm wants to participate in the development of the proposed 500 MW of power, but wants to learn from the installation of the 25 MW plant first.
Mr. Tagomori mentioned the bill currently on the geothermal corridor. would be monitoring the status of the Interagency Group informed. before the legislature He said the Department bill and would keep the
III. Status Report on the Implementation of Act 301
Mr. Tagomori then called on Mr. Dan Lum of the Division of Water and Land Development to update the group on the progress made in implementing Act 301.
Mr. Lum summarized- the intent of Act 301, to provide a consolidated permitting process for geothermal and cable projects. He said that the agencies have cooperated by sending in copies of their respective permitting rules and regulations and permit application forms. The 301 staff has had a chance to identify what permits may be required for various projects, and to study and learn the permitting requirements. The administrative rules are in final draft, and will be distributed to the Interagency Group for their review within the week. Staff has been hired, and office space for the 301 process is being prepared for occupancy. Items are being assembled for the information center function of Act 301, and for the repository for all geothermal and cable information.
.. . . o o
Mr. Tagomori said that a copy of Act 301 will be included in the mailing with the draft administrative rules. He asked that the agencies send in their comments to the administrative rules draft.
IV. Future Meeting Date
Mr. Tagomori called for the next meeting of the Interagency Group to be held March 14, 1989, at the same time and location.
V. Other Business
Mr. Tagomori called on the various County representatives to comment on their activities in the area of geothermal permitting. Mr. Ralph Masuda of Maui County said that the draft rules for Geothermal Resource Permits have been prepared, and that there would be a public hearing on the rules at the end of May. He said hopefully the rules would be adopted in July or August.
Mrs. Susan Labrenz, Managing Director of Hawaii County, commented that Hawaii County officials may be perceived to be cautious in the geothermal area, but she said it is because the County wants to do the project right the first time, and is looking for a good track record.
Mr. Jerry Lesperance said there is assessment on the 500 MW cable being reviewed Department of Business and Economic Development, ready for publication in March 1989. an environmental in draft at the and it should be
Mr. Paty returned from hearings at the legislature and urged the group to push on in working out the consolidated permitting process, because all involved are on a tight time schedule. He said it is this group that can make the geothermal project happen, but the timing is very important •.
Mr. Tagomori said that the schedule calls for the administrative rules to be ready around the fourth of July. He col sed the meeting on that note, andn with a reminder that the next meeting will be on March 14, 1989, same time of day and the same location.

FOR RELEASE AT 10 A.M. (HST) ON FEBRUARY 6, 1989
contact: Scott Shirai (808) 543-5602
Honolulu -- The State of Hawaii and Hawaiian Electric
Company (HECO) today announced plans to seek proposals for
development of one of the world's most innovative electrical
generation and transmission projects.
The goal is to develop 500 megawatts of electricity from
geothermal energy on the island of Hawaii and transmit it by
underwater cable to other islands in the state, primarily to
heavily populated Oahu, a distance of' about 270 miles.
Succes{S.~.\i:l·:c,ompletion of the project would satisfy a major
portion of oahu's electrical demand with geothermal energy and
reduce annual oil imports to the island state by millions of
barrels. Oahu accounts for about 80 percent of the state's
electrical consumption.
The request for proposals (RFP) will be issued in early May.
The project calls for a private consortium to finance and develop
the geothermal energy resource on the island of Hawaii and transmit
electricity from the resource by underwater cable to Oahu, and
possibly Maui as well.

o o
Selection of the developer of the proJect, which is expected
to cost in excess of S1.7 billion, is expected to be made by the
end of 1990.
Driven by near-total dependence on oil imports for its
energy, Hawaii has included increased energy self-sufficiency as
an objective of the Hawaii state Plan.
""Hawaii's energy outlook requires positive action now,"" said
Governor John Waihee. ""We are fortunate to have our own natural
resource for electricity on a commercial scale around the clock.
Development of geothermal energy is the key to achieving state
goals of energy self-sufficiency.""
HECO president Harwood D. Williamson said geothermal energy
has long been seen by his company as Hawaii's best renewable energy
alternative to fuel oil to generate electricity.
""Without question, geothermal energy is the best near-term
renewable energy alternative to meet the base-load needs of our
utilities in satisfying our customers' needs,"" Williamson said.
""Successful completion of this project would be a significant
contribution to making Hawaii more secure and less vulnerable to
the uncertainties of the world oil market.""
Although geothermal energy could not be transmitted to Oahu
until around 1995, the RFP will be issued this year to allow HECO
to consider other alternatives if the response to the RFP shows
that economical geothermal electricity will not be available by then
2
, . o o
Much of the Un1ted States began converting from oil to other
fuels for electrical generation in the 1970s in reaction to the
OPEC oil embargo, but Hawaii's mid-Pacific isolation has prolonged
the state's near-total dependence on fuel oil.
The national average for 011-fired electrical generation is
5.5 percent; Hawaii uses fuel oil to generate more than 90 percent
of its electricity.
The geothermal energy resource on the island of Hawaii, the
""Big Island,"" has been estimated to be at least 500 megawatts,
far more than can be utilized on that island. Hawaii Electric
Light Company, HECO's electric utility subsidiary that serves the
Big Island, had a peak demand in 1988 of approximately 126 megawatts.
A small State-owned research and demonstration geothermal
power plant on Hawaii has supplied approximately 2 megawatts,
enough to service approximately 2,000 homes, to Hawaii Electric
Light Company since 1982.
The RFP calls for development of the existing Geothermal
Resource Subzones in the Kilauea East Rift Zone of the Big
Island's Puna District, where the demonstration plant is located.
This subzone is believed to have the largest geothermal resource
in the island chain.
Early in 1988, the,Governor1s Advisory Committee on the
Geothermal/Cable project, chaired by former Hawaii Governor
William F. Quinn, endorsed qeothermal energy as technically
feasible in Hawaii. The state Legislature at about the same time
consolidated and streamlined geothermal permitting procedures and
funded geothermal exploration and reservoir analYSis.
o o
The export of large amounts of electricity from the Big
Island to Oahu has been studied for years as the best way to
reduce the state's dependence on fuel 011.
Since 1982, HECO has been the prime contractor of the
Hawa1i Deep Water Cable project, which is funded jointly by the
u.s. Department of Energy and the State Department of Business and
Economic Development.
A G/OOO-foot electric cable of a'type that could be deployed
between the islands was manufactured 1n 1987. Laboratory testing
of the cable was concluded in october 1988 and found that the
cable was mechanically and electrically sound.
At-sea testing of deployment and retrieval procedures using
a surrogate, non-electr1c cable, will begin during the last three
months of 1989 in the Alenuihaha Channel between the islands of
Hawaii and Maui.
The Hawaii deep watel- cable will be the longest and deepest
electrical power cable in the world. The deepest portion of the
cable route between the Big Island and Oahu would be approxi-
mately 7,000 feet, in the Alenuihaha Channel.

HAWAII TRIBJNE-HERALD
Group seeking moratorium on geothermal lines By Dave Smith Tribune-Herald
All the while insisting that they do not oppose geothermal developmen~. represe~ tatives of the Puna Commumty Councll yesterday appealed to the County Council for a moratorium on the pending development of proposed high-voltage transmission lines to carry geothermally created electricity.
The group won little sympathy for its proposals from members of the Council's Planning Committee. whom pec President Ron Phillips told that his group fears that if plans are allowed to continue for 69-kilovolt transmission lines to provide power from a
From Page 1 proposed geothermal plant in Pohoiki, much larger lines would eventually follow the same paths.
The Puna council submitted to the Council a petition in which it asked for a moratorium on construction of transmission lines ""until such time that an acceptable socio-economic impact study and a proper environmental impact statement has been prepared.""
But committee members expressed opposition to th~ imposition of any moratorium on geothermal development and filed the document. as is standard procedure for communications to the Council.
However. the committee asked that county Planning Director Duane Kanuha and Council staff monitor the progress of various studies being prepared. including an EIS on the transmission corridors that is currently in the draft stage. ~o construction on the transmission corridors will be allowed unless the EIS is iavorable and the state Public Utilities commission grants approval.
Because the 25-megawatt plant is planned for land designated for agriculture - near the small existing experimental geothermal plant - the county has regulatory powers in
that matter. But the transmission corridors fall under the purview of the state utility regulatory agency, and the Council has no authority in the matter other than to forward recommendations.
In addition, the site for a proposed 500- megawatt facility is on land designated conservation. which falls under the jurisdiction of the state Board of Land and Natural Resources.
Phillips told the committee that the Puna council, a group composed of representatives of 24 community organizations. is ""in no way against geothermal energy."" He said the moratorium sought by his group is ""not targeted against ORMAT by any stretch of the imagination.""
ORMAT is the Nevada-based subsidiary of an Israeli company that last year purchased the company that originally contracted with Helco to deliver 25 megawatts of electricity. beginning with 12.5 megawatts by the end of 1989 or early next year.
In fact. Phillips said in light of a reCent meeting with electric company and geothermal officials, which he said was the first in two years to yield positive results. PCC is ""amenable"" to the latest proposal for the route the 69 Kv lines would take.
Hawaii Electric Light Co. recently proposed moving the corridor through which the two transmission lines would pass to aiong Highway 130. the Pahoa-Keeau road, from the former path through various subdivisions. The lines are to connect with the Big Island's power grid at the Keeau substation.
While PCC members say they agree to the new placement of the lines, which they said they are concerned about for health, safety and aesthetic considerations. they have asked Helco to consider placing them underground.
But a Helco spokesman told the committee members that running the lines underground would cost five to seven times more than placing the lines on towers or poles and therefore is not feasible.
Phillips replied that ""cost, in this case. cannot always be the bottom line.""
The Puna council members may have found some consolation in the· words of Councilwoman Helene Hale. who said the large scale project ""will never happen.""
Hale said that in her opinion, because the geothermal project has faced so many obstacles in its current smaller scale. the larger project will not come to be for some time, if ever.

The authors located the events on a semi-realtime basis using automatic software for picking, and the locations were fed back to the pumping side for determination of further injection plan. The locations of seismic events showed sub-horizontal extension of the reservoir to 1,800 m away from the injection well at a depth of around 4,500 m. The heterogeneous source migration suggests that the fractures in the stimulated zone were close to a critically stressed state.",1. INTRODUCTION,"The importance of “green energy” which is environmentally friendly to the earth has been widely understood and accepted in developed countries, and projects for the development of geothermal systems have been started/re-stared in many countries. It has been revealed by data observation from thousands of existing wells that some part of Australia has large volumes of high heat production granites in the depth range of 3 to 5km below the surface (http://hotrock.anu.edu.au/resource.htm). The Cooper Basin, South Australia, has one of the most promising geothermal resources, the temperature in the granitic basement is expected to exceed 270˚C at a depth of around 5km. It is also reported that the horizontal stress is dominant over the vertical in central Australia including in the Cooper Basin (Swenson et al., 2000). These scientific investigations suggest that a horizontal HDR reservoir with a large heat production capacity, which enables generation of electricity with comparable costs to coal, can be realized in the Cooper Basin (http://www.geodynamics.com.au).
A public company Geodynamics Limited started development of a HDR system in early 2003 supported by the Australian national and local governments. In 2003 the company drilled the first injection borehole to a depth of 4421m penetrating into granite approximately 750 m. They confirmed that the bottomhole temperature is around 250 ˚C in this borehole and started the preparation of stimulation to create HDR reservoir.
The Japanese researchers, who have a long experience in the microseismic monitoring of HDR reservoirs, organized
a team for the data collection and on-site mapping at the Cooper Basin site. The aim of the contribution of the Japanese team is to cooperate with the Australian side in understanding the reservoir using knowledge accumulated by the Japanese side and to improve mapping techniques using the collected data. The Japanese team started system design, coding software and necessary maintenance of the facilities under collaboration with Geodynamics in 2002, and the subsequent seismic monitoring at the Cooper Basin site is described in this paper.",2. PROJECT DESCRIPTION,"A plan view of the Cooper Basin site is shown in Figure-1 as well as its location in the country. Geodynamics Limited drilled the first injection well (Habanero 1) into a granitic basement to a depth of 4,421 m (754 m into granite) in 2003. The bottom hole temperature was measured by logging at approximately 250˚C, showing considerably good potential for power generation from an HDR reservoir. Several sub horizontal over pressured fractures were found in the granitic section of the well. Geodynamics have changed their concept because of these fractures, and now refer to the project as hot fractured rock or HFR. Some of the existing fractures were plugged to stop lost circulation and only one fracture at a depth of 4,254m in the Habanero-1 remained as the initial dominant entry point into the formation. Because the maximum tectonic stress is horizontal in the central part of Australia, the orientation of the existing fractures are consistent with the global stress field.
The seismic network at the site consists of one deep (depth: 1,794 m) high temperature (150˚C) instruments, three downhole instruments (depth: 200 400 m), and four near surface instruments (depth: 100m). The high temperature downhole seismic detector which has been developed and used in Hijiori HDR Project was deployed as a deep, hightemperature station. Geodynamics and CRIEPI prepared the seismic network with support from JAPEX. The offset to the furthest station was approximately 5 km. Because no data from shooting is available in this case, horizontal (2D) velocity structure was mainly determined by previously collected data from sonic logs and VSP. The Japanese team set up two A/D systems in parallel. Mapping of induced seismic events was carried out at the site on a semi-realtime basis using the computer system and software from Tohoku University and AIST.
The main stimulation took place after several tests to initiate fractures (fracture initiation tests: FIT) and evaluate their hydraulic characteristics (long term flow test: LFT). The total amount of liquid injected was 20,000 m3 with a highest pumping rate of 48 l/s. All the open hole section was pressurized in the first and main stimulation. A second stimulation was performed through perforated casing above
the open hole section, but this stimulation was dominated by fluid flow back into the main stimulated zone below.",3. SEISMIC ACTIVITY,"A typical seismic trace collected during the stimulation is shown in Figure-2. The seismic events were detected by the network from the initial stage of the FIT where the pumping rate is around 8 l/s. Most of the seismic signals were detected by the near-surface stations with clear onsets of P and S waves. We recorded 32,000 triggers and 11,724 of these were located in 3D space and time on site until the end of the stimulations (on 23 December 2003). Some of the seismic events had large energy and people on the site could feel them. Roughly estimated magnitude of the largest event was M3.7.",4. SEISMIC LOCATION,"In this study, we used a 2D (horizontal) velocity model for overburden which is determined by the data from VSP and logging, and a homogeneous velocity in granite. Because no data was available to precisely estimate the velocity of P wave in the granite, we decided to optimize the velocity in granite by fitting the initial events to the existing fracture at 4,254m in Habanero-1 by changing the velocity in the granite. There was no data on velocity for S wave both in basement and overburden, the picks for S wave was not used for on-site mapping. The onsets were detected by manual observations and software for automatic picking (Soma et al., 2003) depending on the event rate. The highest average event rate was 1,000 per day.
The 3D distribution of the seismic locations for all the tests and stimulations is shown in Figure-3. The locations were estimated by a single event determination method. It is clearly seen that a sub horizontal seismic cloud with thickness of around 500m and horizontal extension of 1,800m from Habanero-1 was created. The typical residual (error) in the location of the events was 13m, where vertical error is dominant because of shallow network configurations. Location of events with larger energy is shown in Figure-4. The location of the large events has a trend where they are distributed near the injection well and on the south and NW edge of the seismic cloud.
The horizontal source migration (change in horizontal distance from Habanero-1) is shown in Figure-5 along with the pumping rate, wellhead pressure and total amount of injected fluid. It is seen that (a) the number of located events is correlated to the total amount of injected fluid and (b) the seismic cloud grew heterogeneously in the horizontal direction.
The seismic events were re-located by a collapsing method, which is a statistical optimization of the whole cloud (Jones and Stewart, 1997). The vertical distribution of the seismic location by the collapsing is shown in Figure-6. The thickness of the seismic cloud remains approximately 100m after collapsing, suggesting that the surrounding zone of the existing fracture at 4,254m was seismically active. It is probable that the collapsing method has reduced the locations to a volume more condensed than the true volume.
The seismic locations in the FIT and LFT are compared with that of the main stimulations in Figure-7. It is clearly seen that during the main stimulations, an aseismic zone occurred around injection well, Habanero 1. This aseismic zone is spatially correlated with the locations of events produced in the earlier FIT and LFT.",5. INTERPRETATION,"The seismic activities and locations while the FIT, LFT and the main stimulations suggest the following characteristics of the HDR reservoir at Cooper Basin.
(1) Both the higher seismic activity from the initial stage of the FIT and heterogeneous extension of the seismic cloud suggest that the fractures near the existing fracture are under critical or overcritical stress state. The seismic cloud did not initially spread across all the openhole section as their locations were limited to the depth around the existing fracture at 4,254m. The plugging of the other fractures strongly avoided water penetration inside these other fractures. The seismic cloud after perforation of casing pipe also did not extended horizontally very much because the flow impedance of the existing main fracture may be much lower than the others and the dominant flow path was created to the existing main fracture in near field.
(2) The seismic density (number of events/volume of the seismic cloud) of the Cooper Basin site is 4,800/km3
which is much lower than that at Soultz (11,800/ km3). In general, seismic density is considered to be correlated to the improvement of permeability after stimulation, and, hence, there is a possibility that the flow impedance around the existing fracture has not increased as much as at Soultz. We need results from circulation tests for further interpretation. However, the naturally high overpressures discovered in the main fractures point to existing high permeability and probable natural stimulation of the fractures as these overpressures developed.
(3) The thickness of the seismic cloud is much larger than the error in mapping. The collapsed seismic cloud showed planer structure with thickness of 100-150m. It is reasonable to interpret this observation as though the stimulated rock mass with seismic activity extended 100-150m away from the existing fracture. Considering the stress state and orientation of existing joints in the granite, we can assume that a system of sub-parallel horizontal fractures was stimulated.
(4) The seismic cloud did not extend into the sedimentary basin overburden even if there is some possible variation in the depth of the granitic basement.
(5) The seismically activated zone in the FIT and LFT became aseismic in the main stimulations, especially in
the south-east side of Habanero-1. Presumably the FIT and LFT experiments resulted in both increased permeability in the aseismic zone and the release of differential stress within the affected rock volume.
(6) Some of the larger events seem as though they broke some geological “barrier”, showing breakthrough beyond the barrier after the large event. Most of the large events in the stimulations appeared within the existing seismic cloud. Although the detail has not been fully investigated there may be some difference in the reservoir extension in the FIT/LFT and main stimulations.",6. CONCLUSIONS,"The Japanese team for microseismic monitoring at the Cooper Basin HDR/HFR project successfully detected and located approximately 12,000 events during the injection of 20,000m3 of liquid. The seismic cloud showed subhorizontal shape with thickness of 500m and horizontal extension of 3.2km. It is consistent with the initial design based on existing geological information.
The sub-horizontal distribution of the seismic cloud/reservoir can be effectively used to develop a HFR system with lower risk in targeting of the following wells. Also of benefit is the existence of the overpressured fractures containing 250˚C water. This overpressured state should bring better production rates with larger amounts of energy extracted from the granite although further investigation is required through pumping/circulation tests after drilling of a second borehole.

CONCEPTS IN UNITIZATION OF FEDERAL GEOTHERMAL LEASES
1 2 Kirk Cargill and Robert D. Conover
‘Area Geothermal Office, U.S. Geological Survey, Menlo Park, CA 2Field Solicitor, U.S. Department of the Interior, Riverside, CA
This paper presents some of the concepts of unitization, to help the operator understand what to expect from a Federal unit agreement. Federal units are authorized for geothermal Irrsources under the Geothermal Steam Act of 197 -, and are provided for in detail in the regulations.2’ Guidelines and procedures for preparation of agreements and formation of units are available from the Office of the Area Geothermal Supervisor, U.S. Geological Survey, 345 Middlefield Road, Menlo Park, CA 94025.
Definition and Objective of Unitization
Unitization (as it relates to the exploration, extraction, and development of geothermal resources on Federal lands) can be defined as the consolidation or merger of all interests in a given geothermal reservoir or resource area in order that the area or part thereof so designated can be developed or oper9)ed as an entity without regard to separate ownerships.-
Unitization also characterizes the joint operations through a specified operator for explorations on designated parcels of land for the development of all or part of a producing reservoir. It effects a merging of all the involved geothermal leases into one contract and a vesting in the lessors of a r’ ht to participate in any royalty produced on any tract.- A9
Unitization is a conservation measure that benefits both the lessor and lessee, tending to promote economic development of steam which must be utilized near t e producing area, and to prevent waste of the resource.- 5 P
Further, unitization permits the exploration and development of a geothermal resources area by a single operator without regard to the surface or lease boundary lines. The integration of field operations over a unit area will permit, for example, the drilling and operations of only those wells necessary to produce the required amounts of steam for electrical generation purposes, the use of field gathering steamlines, and the control of pressures and heat flows, and reinjection, as necessary, for stable field operations.
- 11 Section 18, 30 U.S.C. 21 30 CFR, Part 271
1007 - - 31 cf. Campbellv. Field, 229 F. 2d 197 (1956) - 41 cf. Ambassador Oil Corp. v. Robertson, (Tex Civ ADD.) 384 S.W. 2d 752 - 51 ck-phillips Petroleum Co. v. Peterson, (CA10 Utah), 218 F. 2d 926, Cert. den., 349 U.S. 947, 99 L. Ed 1273 (1954)
In many respects, all leases that are co itted to T-9 a unit agreement are treated as a single lease.Advantages of Unitization
In order to fulfill its purpose, a unit agreement should be advantageous to all committed lands and interests. While the owners of the various lands and interests that may be committed to a unit agreement have many diverse purposes, there are several advantages common to both lessees and lessors:
Wells can be drilled on the basis of geology instead of lease lines. Normally unit areas are not subject to spacing requirements, and locations are selected according to the optimum probabilities of finding and producing the resource.
An area usually can be fully developed with fewer wells when development takes place under a unit instead of under a lease, particularly when an area contains small leases. Under a unit agreement small drainable leases need not be drilled in order to receive their full participation.
a.
b.
c. Except for drilling near the unit boundary, drainage is not a problem. Selecting drilling locations to avoid drainage is easier and frequently fewer wells are drilled.
d. The use of common facilities avoids duplication of equipment. Under a unit agreement, right-of-way permits are not required for gathering lines to cross lease boundaries.
e. The fewer wells, roads, or facilities needed not only cut the expense of producing geothermal power, but also make the gebthermal industry more acceptable to the public by lessening the environmental impact of development.
f. The development and operation of an area under a unit agreement conserves the geothermal resource, prevents waste, and increases profit for both lessee and lessor. Because lessees are no longer in competition for production, the unit operator can analyze and plan for maximum production and minimum waste. Proper planning of a unit area will result in lower drilling and equipment costs because fewer wells will be drilled. The geothermal industry is still young and we know
- 61 Cf. 69 I.D. 110, M-36629 (1962); 64 I.D. 405 (1957); 59 I.D. 383 (1947)
little about the effect of production rates on ultimate recovery. Unitization will enhance our chances to learn and apply methods to protect the reservoir and ensure maximum recovery.
g. The simplified reporting for unitized lands may not seem to be a great advantage, but all of us engaged in today's paper storm appreciate any decrease in paperwork. Any lease report may be applied to all leases in the unitized area and copies made for each lease. Common reporting is easier than preparing separate reports for each lease. The Federal unit-agreement form provides that work performed on one lease is treated as work performed on or for all leases. Federal reports presumably will meet requirements for State and local reports.
h. Preparing an environmental analysis (EA) for a unit area takes less time than preparing individual EA% for each lease. Subsequent EA'S for a unit area are handled in the same way as subsequent EA'S for a single lease.
i. Certain environmentally sensitive areas will not be leasable unless all operations are done under an approved unit agreement.
Certain advantages of unitization are of primary concern to the lessee:
a. Unitized acreage is not charged against pf 20,480-acre limit allowed to each lessee in each State.-
b. Drilling on one committed lease amounts to drilling on all committed leases. Therefore, drilling in progress on a unit across the 10th anniversary gf a Federal lease extends that lease for another 5 years.-
c. Production from any committed lands will extend the term of any lease as long as the lease remains committed to the unit agreement.
d. Reinjection problems are simplified. The unit operator can inject into any suitable well on any committed lands. Reinjection sites can be selected solely by reservoir characteristics and not because of availability.
e. The unit operator can commit larger areas as reserves to individual plants and is in an improved position to ,negotiate for the sale of the resource. Production from any well or group of wells is not necessarily tied to one plant but can be shifted as the need arises.
f. Unitization simplifies the sale of t he resource because only one sales contract is needed instead of a contract for each lease.
g. The operator can spread costs of reducing These costs could impose an environmental impacts. excessive burden on a single lease.
Some advantages pertain primarily to lessors:
a. Unitization assures rapid, continuous exploration and development. The terms of most exploratory unit
agreements require the commencement of drilling within 6 months after the effective date of the agreement. Thereafter a well must be commenced within 6 months after the completion of the previous well until completion of a well capable of production in paying quantities.
b. Administration of leases is simplified when only one operator is involved.
c. Unitization simplifies the mitigation of environmental impacts.
Form of Unit Agreement
An exploration unit agreement is used for the exploration, development, and production of geothermal resources in ,unproved areas. A producing unit agreement is used for the production of the resource when only limited development remains. The form of unit agreement set forth in the regulations (modified to fit the c' umstances) is recommended for use in unproved areas3' For a producing unit considerable modification is done, usually including changing the formula for allocation; these modifications do not affect the amount of Federal control. If the Federal lands involved exceed 10% of a unit area, the usual Federal form is generally required. If less than 5% of the lands are in Federal ownership, a lessee's adapted form relinquishing all Federal control over the unit mea, but not control over Federal lands, will be acceptable. When Federal ownership is 5%-lo%, the form of unit agreement is determined by the location of the Federal lands and other circumstances at the time of unitizat ion.
Each agreement, upon approval of the Secretary of the Interior, is a separate contract between private parties, and its terms control the exploration, drilling, development, or utilization of geothefppl resources on the lands committed to the contract.- Article 1 7 of the unit agreement modifies and amends the regulations and lease terms to conform to the provisions of the agreement so that the agreement governs the activities of the parties in the operations thereunder.
Any subsequent modifications require the same approvals under similar procedures of all parties executing the original agreement.
Commitment Status Necessary for Final Approval
No unit agreement can be approved by the Director of the U.S. Geological Survey unless at least one party holds a Federal leyf/embracing lands being committed to the agreement.- The percentage of fully committed lands necessary for approval of a unit agreement is not fixed, but the commitment status must be sufficient to give the unit operator effective control of operations within the unit area. A commitment status of at least 80% of the lands is desirable; however, lands believed to be only marginally productive have less impact than lands believed to be in a more productive part of t h e area. Each application is judged independently as to whether the unit operator can effectively control operations in the unit area.

Size and Boundary Considerations
The acreage in a unit area varies to fit the circumstances of each case. Ideally the area should consist of one entire reservoir. This condition is not always possible, either because of lack of geologic knowledge or because the reservoir is too large for one unit area to be practical. The area should be defined on all sides by a geologic feature such as faults or contours of thermal gradient. Normally the unit boundary follows section lines, but with sufficient justification, the boundary can follow smaller legal subdivision lines. Setting unit boundaries on the basis of legal subdivisions is usually easier for producible or production units than for exploratory units.
For an exploratory unit, the unit area may consist of all those sections which are cut by an appropriate geologic feature or may consist of all those sections of which at lease 50% of the section is located within the geologic feature. The unit operator may use either method to determine the boundary but must consistently use the chosen method.
More subsurface knowledge is available to the operator when forming producing or producible units. Therefore, the unit boundary can be more precisely determined for a producing or producible unit than for an exploratory unit. The boundary must not split a lot or quarterquarter section because these are the smallest legal subdivisions recognized by the Bureau of Land Managem en t.
A unit area may require more than one initial test well in order to adequately test the potential of the geothermal resource. If the proposed unit area exceeds 25,000 acres, Article XI of the unit agreement may require the drilling of two or more wells located in different blocks or separated by a specific distance, regardless of the results of the first well. The 25,000- acre figure is somewhat flexible and is used as a guideline only. For example, two wells might be required for an elongate or irregular unit of 20,000 acres whereas a single well might adequately test a roughly square area of 28,000 acres.
Unit Operating Agreement
The unit operating agreement is an agreement entered into by the working interest owners when more than one working interest is involved. The U.S. Geological Survey is not a party to this agreement. The Survey does require that in case of conflict the unit agreement prevail over the unit operating agreement.
Unit W e l l
To qualify as the initial unit well, the well must be drilled under an approved plan of operation. The well also must be drilled diligently to the target formation or depth, or must be proved producible in paying quantities, at a lessor depth, or further drilling must be declared unwarranted or impractical.
Forming the Participating Area
Article 11 (d) of the unit agreement defines a participating areas as ""That part of the Unit Area which is deemed to be productive from a horizon or deposit and to which production would be allocated in the manner
described in the unit agreement assuming that all lands are committed to the unit agreement."" All geologic information known on the effective date of the participating area will be used to determine the lands reasonably proven productive for inclusion in the participating area. An allocation schedule effective on a particular date will remain effective until new information is obtained. The new information usually results from the drilling of a well, but there are other sources of data. For example, production over an. extended period of time may indicate that an original assumption regarding reservoir extent was incorrect. A revision of an existing participating area can eliminate lands as well as add lands. Land can never be eliminated from a participating area because of depletion of the resource, but land can be eliminated from a participating area when new information indicates that the land should never have been included.
Allocation Formula for the Exploration Unit
The formula for the allocation of production from a participating area must be agreed upon by all parties and contained in the unit agreement before the various interests can be committed. For an exploration unit, acreage is the only parameter known with certainty throughout the area. Therefore, except in rare and unusual circumstances, the allocation formula for an exploration unit is based solely on the acreage in the participating area.
Once a unit's allocation formula is established, it cannot be changed without the consent of every party to the agreement. This consent is virtually impossible to obtain because any change in allocation obviously reduces someone's allocation. Probably no party will be willing to accept less because of information not known at the time of the original agreement. When acting as a party to a unit agreement, the executive branch of the Federal government does not have the authority to waive a contractural right and to accept a lesser share than in the previous allocation formula.
Members of the oil and gas industry are well aware that prolonged legal controversy can be avoided only if the matter of allocation is permanently settled before the exploration unit is formed. Probably, the geothermal industry practice will not differ.
Allocation Formula for a Producing Unit
When an extensively studied area is unitized after production has begun, the formula for allocation of unitized substances can be based on several parameters. The actual selection of the parameters and the percentage weight given to each depend on the circumstances involved. Some common parameters that can be used under certain circumstances are acre-feet of pay, productivity of wells, past production, and pseudoproductivity factors. To be considered productive, an area must be nearly developed or completely developed. Again, we emphasize that parties to the unit agreement should realize that the agreed-upon formula is fixed and virtually impossible to change.
All adjustments of investments must be set forth in the unit operating agreement. Basing any portion of the allocation formula on adjustment of investment is unfair to the basic royalty owners.
Uncommitted Lands in a Participating Area
Only geologic and engineering information is used to determine the participating area. Whether or not all lands in the participating area are committed to the unit agreement is of no importance. Any uncommitted lands in the participating area receive zero percent allocation. If uncommitted lands in a participating area are committed later pursuant to Article XXV of the agreement, the allocation schedule is revised to reflect the new commitment status. The effective date of the revised schedule is the effective date of the subsequent joinder.
Automatic Elimination of Lands From a Unit Area
Pursuant to Article IV of the agreement, lands in the unit are automatically eliminated if they are not within a participating area on the fifth anniversary of the effective date of the initial participating area. The geothermal unit agreement allows for a time delay from the completion of a producib{$Fell until a plant is built and production commences.- This time delay is created because the drilling requirements cease upon the completion of a producible well, but the 5-year countdown before automatic elimination does not begin until production commences.
Extension of Time for Drilling
Under Article XI of the unit agreement, a unit well must be started within 6 months after the effective date of the agreement and the drilling program must be continuous thereafter with no more than a 6 months' lapse between the completion of one well and the beginning of another well unless unitized substances in paying quantities are discovered or unless an extension of time is granted by the Area Geothermal Supervisor.
An extension of time for the initial test well is granted only for very unusual and unavoidable circumstances. Therefore, a unit operator should not file an executed unit agreement with the Supervisor for final approval until the working interests are prepared to proceed with the initial test well.
After the initial well, or any subsequent well, has been drilled, an extension of time will normally be granted if the unit operator needs time to evaluate the resulting data. If one extension has been granted and another extension is requested before the drilling of another well, the second extension will require very strong justification. A third extension of time without the drilling of a well is rarely permitted.
An extension of time to meet a drilling requirement is usually from 2-6 months, depending on the circumstances. An extension of less than 2 months is rarely worthwhile for the operator, and an extension of more than 6 months requires very strong justification.
A unit operator must apply for an extension of time before the critical date under the drilling requirement. Because the unit agreement terminates automatically upon failure to fulfill the drilling requirement by the specified date, the Supervisor cannot grant an extension for an agreement which no longer exists.

Sampling and analysis of geothermal effluents is an important problem in the effort to ensure the development of geothermal energy in an environmentally responsible manner. Yet the need for good sampling and analytical methods is common to many operational aspects of geothermal energy across the full cycle of exploration, assessment, production, and 9tilization. An example is the study of radon emanation in geothermal fluids. Radon sampling, detection and measurement have had extensive study because radon is a radioactive gas. Yet as a chemical constituent of geothermal fluids it can act as an internal tracer for studies of reservoir physics and engineering. The concentration of radon in produced geofluids depends on several independent factors, among them the distribution of radium in the formation, the emanating power of the produced radon, and the transport time of the radon from emanation to sampling sites.
The distribution of radium in a geothermal system is a function of the hydrochemical and thermochemical history of the formation and its infiltrating geofluids. The emanating power is a function of the physical state of the formation. And the transport time of the radon is a function of the hydrodynamic properties of the reservoir. Thus, studies of radon concentration in produced geofluids, as a function of time in a single well, in wells distributed over a geothermal area, and in wells in different geothermal areas, each with flow conditions as a major parameter, may afford a detailed understanding not only of the role of radon as a component of geothermal fluids, but also of reservoir transport phenomena both under steady-flow and transient-flow conditions.

GEOTHERMAL RESOURCES OPERATIONAL ORDER NO. 4
Effective August 1, 1975
GENERAL ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION REQUIREMENTS
This Order is established pursuant to the authority prescribed
in 30 CE'R 270.11 and in accordance with 30 CFR 270.2, 270.34(k),
270.37, 270.41, 270.42, 270.43, 270.44, and 270.76. Lessees shall comply with the provisions of this Order. All variances from the requirements specified in this Order shall be subject to approval pursuant to 30 CFR 270.48. References in this Order to approvals, determinations, or requirements are to those given or made by the Area Geothermal Supervisor (Supervisor) or his delegated representative.
All data submitted under this Order shall be available for
inspection in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act of 1966 (P.L. 89-487 ), as amended in 1974 (P.L. 93-502), except information such as geological, geophysical, reservoir, trade secrets, and financial data and interpretations of such data, maps, and related files for which a lessee requests proprietary
status, provided that such status is determined by the Supervisor to be warranted and is approved by appropriate officials of the Department of the Interior.
19°52 /,
f. b
Protection of the environment includes the lessee's responsi-
bility to: conduct exploration and development operations in a manner that provides maximum protection of the environment; rehabilitate disturbed lands; take all necessary precautions to protect the public health and safety; and conduct operations in accordance with the spirit and objectives of all applicable Federal environmental legislation and supporting executive orders.
Adverse environmental impacts from geothermal-related activity
shall be prevented or mitigated through enforcement of applicable Federal, State, and local standards, and the application of existing technology. Inability to meet these environmental standards or continued violation of environmental standards due to operations of the lessee, after notification, may be construed as grounds for the Supervisor to order a suspension of operations.
The lessee shall be responsible for the monitoring of readily
identifiable localized environmental impacts associated with specific activities that are under the control of the lessee. Monitoring of environmental impacts may be conducted by the use of aerial surveys, inspections, periodic samplings, continuous recordings, or by such other means or methods as required by the Supervisor. Due to the differing natural environmental conditions among geothermal areas, the extent and frequency of such monitoring activities will be determined by the Supervisor on an individual basis. In the event the Supervisor determines that the degree and adequacy of existing environmental protection regulations in certain areas are insufficient, the Supervisor may establish additional and more stringent
4-2
:
requirements by the issuance of field orders or by modifying existing orders.
Lessees shall provide for acquisition of environmental baseline
data as required in accordance with 30 CFR 270.34(k) for a period of one year prior to submission of a plan for production. Techniques and standards to be used by the lessee for meeting these requirements shall receive prior approval by the -Supervisor. The lessee, in accordance with the requirements of 30 CFR 270.76, shall file in duplicate with the Supervisor, on or before March 1 of each year, an annual report of compliance with environmental protection requirements for the previous calendar year.
1. Aesthetics. The lessee shall reduce visual impact, where
feasible, by the careful selection of sites for operations and facilities on leased lands. The design and construction of facilities shall be conducted in a manner such that the facilities will blend into the natural environmental setting of the area by the appropriate use of landscaping, vegetation, compatible color schemes, and minimum profiles. Native plants or other compatible vegetation shall be used, where possible, for landscaping and revegetation.
2.. Land Use and Reclamation. Operating plans shall be design-
ed so that operations will result in the least disturbance of land, water, and vegetation. Existing roads shall be used where suitable. Entry upon certain environmentally fragile land areas, as designated by the surface management agency, may be either seasonally restricted
4-3
or restricted to special vehicles or transportation methods which will minimize disturbance to the surface or other resources as specified by the Supervisor and surface management agency.
Operating plans shall provide for the reclamation and re-
vegetation of all disturbed lands in a manner approved by the Supervisor.and the appropriate surface management agency. Land reclamation may include preparation«and seeding with prescribed wildlife food and plant cover or improved and acceptable substitutes thereof which will equal or enhance the food values for indigenous wildlife species and domesticated animals. Temporary fencing for such reclaimed areas may be required to facilitate restoration
thereof.
The lessee shall at all times maintain the leased lands in
a safe and orderly condition and shall perform the operations in a workmanlike manner. The lessee shall remove or store all supplies, equipment, and scrap in a timely and orderly fashion.
Operations under a geothermal lease shall not unreasonably
interfere with or endanger operations under any other lease, license, claim, permit, or other authorized use on the same lands.
3: Public Access. The public shall have free and unrestrict-
ed access to geothermal leased lands, excepting however, where restrictions are necessary to protect public health and safety or where such public access would unduly interfere with the lessee's operations or the security thereof. The lessee shall provide
4-4
..
warning signs, fencing, flagmen, barricades, or other safety measures deemed necessary by the Supervisor to protect the public, wildlife, and livestock from hazardous geothermal or related activities.
4. Recreation. Recreational values shall be adequately pro-
tected through planning and designing of site development to minimize the aesthetic degradation of the particular recreation area. The lessee shall generally be restricted from surface locations for drilling and other lease operations within 61 metres ( 200 feet ) of
established recreation sites and access routes thereto. However, the lessee may relocate a recreational site and/or access routes thereto when approved by the Supervisor with the concurrence of
the land management agency.
5. Slope Stability and Erosion Control. Operations shall be
conducted in such a manner so as to minimize erosion and disturbance to natural drainage. The lessee shall provide adequate erosion and drainage control to prevent sediments from disturbed sites from entering water courses for soil and natural resource conservation protection.
Mitigating measures to lessen environmental damage may
include reseeding of disturbed soils, chemical stabilization, and dust and erosion control on well sites, roads, and construction
areas.
All operating plans shall give proper consideration to
the potential hazards of slope instability. Where potentially
4-5
unstable ground conditions exist, design of proposed roads, drill sites, and surface facilities shall be approved by and constructed under the supervision of a qualified engineer or engineering geologist satisfactory to the Supervisor.
6. Biota. The lessee shall conduct all operations in such a
manner as to afford reasonable protection of fish, wildlife and natural habitat. The lessee shall take such measures as are necessary for the conservation of endangered and threatened species of flora and fauna as set forth in applicable executive orders, regulations, and State or Federal legislation such as the Endangered Species Act of 1973 and the Migratory Bird Act of 1966. When such species would be adversely affected by the lessee's operations on the leased lands, the lessee shall implement those measures necessary to minimize or eliminate such adverse effects and to protect the flora and fauna as specified by the Supervisor in accordance with recommendations by appropriate Federal and State agencies. Such measures may be in addition to provisions set forth in the lease or accompanying stipulations.
The Supervisor may receive information from recognized
experts that a delicate balance of flora and/or fauna exists in the area of operations or proposed operations. Upon receiving such notice, the Supervisor will request timely advice and assistance from appropriate Federal and State agencies regarding:
(1) an assessment of the status of flora and fauna in the area
4-6
which may be adversely affected by operations, and (2) advice as to reasonable mitigating measures appropriate to minimizing or preventing adverse trends in populations, growth, vegetative recovery, or repopulations in potentially affected flora and/or fauna. Based on timely receipt of advice from appropriate agencies, the Supervisor will direct the lessee to take appropriate measures to minimize significant adverse trends in flora and fauna. Such measures may include, but not be limited to, revegetation with grasses, shrubs, or other vegetation of high forage values desirable for habitat, replacement of fauna where lost, replacement of water supply, or sources where destroyed.
Where the lessee's operations have destroyed significant
flora and/or fauna or their natural habitat and replacement by natural processes will not take place in a normal growth cycle, the lessee shall take reasonable measures to replace those species or their habitat with the same or other acceptable species or habitat as directed by the Supervisor. The Supervisor's requirements shall be based on recommendations and advice received from appropriate Federal and State agencies.
7. Cultural Resources Preservation. The lessee shall exercise
due diligence in the conduct of his operations to protect and preserve significant archaeological, historical, cultural, paleontological, and unique geologic sites. The lessee shall not disturb any known cemetery or burial ground of any group or culture.
4-7
Previously unknown sites uncovered by the lessee shall be
immediately reported to the Supervisor, and operations on the particular site shall cease until said site can be assessed for its archaeological value and preservation. Necessary controls and remedial actions for the protection and preservation of cultural resources shall be issued on an individual site basis by the
Supervisor as warranted.
The preservation, restoration, maintenance, and nomination
of all resources for purposes of the National Register of Historic Places shall be in accordance with the provisions of Executive Order 11593 ( 36 FR 8921 ) entitled, ""Protection and Enhancement of the Cultural Environment"", or any amendments thereto.
8. Subsidence and Seismicity. Surveying of the land surface
prior to and during geothermal resources production will be required for determining any changes in elevation of the leased lands. Lessees shall make such resurveys as required by the Supervisor to ascertain if subsidence is occurring. Production data.r pressures, reinjection rates, and volumes shall be accurately recorded and filed monthly with the Supervisor as provided in 30 CFR 270.37. In the event subsidence activity results from the production of geothermal resources, as determined by surveys by the lessee or a governmental body, the lessee shall take such mitigating actions as are required by the lease terms and by the Supervisor.
If subsidence is determined by the Supervisor to present
a significant hazard to operations or adjoining land use, then
4-8
the Supervisor may require remedial action including, but not limited to, reduced production rates, increased injection of waste
or other fluids, or a suspension of production.
A. Surveys. All required surveys shall be second order
or better and shall be conducted under the direct supervision of a registered civil engineer or licensed land surveyor using equipment acceptable by the National Ocean Survey for second order surveys. All such work shall be coordinated with the county surveyor of the county in which the surveys and bench marks are to be established.

GEOLOGY, PETROLEUM DEVELOPMENT, AND SEISMICITY OF THE
SANTA BARBARA CHANNEL REGION, CALIFORNIA
PETROLEUM DEVELOPMENT IN THE SANTA BARBARA CHANNEL REGION
By R. F. YERKES, H. C. WAGNER,and K. A. YENNE
PRODUCTION
Petroleum has been associated with human culture in the region of the Santa Barbara Channel for many hundreds of years. Active natural seeps of tar, oil, and gas are present in and along the margins of the channel, and in prehistoric times asphalt from them was used in tool- and weapon-making. At the present time, there are about 20 producing oil and gas fields in the immediate channel area, and products from these dominate the local economy. A recent survey estimates that of the $310 million income annually developed in Santa Barbara County alone, about onethird (32 percent) comes from oil and gas production (Bickmore, 1967). Lesser percentages are from agriculture ( 21 percent), manufacturing (20 percent), tourism (13 percent), and others (14 percent).
California is the dominant crude -oil producer in the U.S. Bureau of Mines District V, which also includes Arizona, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington. In 1968 District V had a total supply of 1,877,800 bpd (barrels per day) of crude oil, of which California oil fields produced about 65 percent, or 1,216,500 bpd, and of which 661,300 bpd were imported, chiefly from foreign sources ( Conservation Committee of California Oil Producers, 1969).
California's 1968 crude oil production of 375 million barrels was valued at nearly $1 billion; of this total, the fields of the Santa Barbara Channel region produced 22.9 million barrels (table 1) or 6.1 percent. For comparison, oil fields of the Los Angeles basin produced 160.9 million barrels, or 43 percent of California's total. At the end of 1968 the Santa Barbara Channel region had produced 1.1 billion barrels of crude oil or
about 7.5 percentof California's cumulative production, compared with the Los Angeles basin's 5.87 billion
barrels or 40 percent.
The development of the petroleum resources of the area can be traced from early descriptions of natural seeps, on which the first wells were located, through extensions to offshore and onshore fields, to discovery of fields by sophisticated geologic and geophysical methods in aread covered by hundreds of feet of
water.
NATURAL SEEPS NEAR SANTA BARBARA
Many active natural seeps of asphalt or tar, and oil and gas, occur onshore along the inland margins of the channel as well as offshore in the tidal zone and on the deeper sea floor (pl. 2).
ONSHORE ASPHALT DEPOSITS
Although many of the onshore asphalt deposits have been obliterated, the existence of an extensive literature makes it possible to describe some of the more important ones. The largest ones were at Carpinteria and at More's Landing; numerous others occur along the sea cliffs between Point Conception and Punta Gorda near the Rincon oil field (pl. 2).
The asphalt deposit at Carpinteria was located near the sea cliff, about half a mile southeast of town. The archeologic record reveals that aborigines used asphalt for holding points on weapons (Abbott, 1879); and Spanish explorers, dating back to at least 1775, observed that Indians near the present site of Carpinteria used tar from those deposits to calk their boats and to seal their water pitchers ( Heizer, 1943). As early as 1857 the Carpinteria deposit supplied material

One of these, the deepest offshore well known at the time, bottomed at a drilled depth of 14,850 feet, a vertical depth of 13,622 feet, and a horizontal distance of 5,632 feet from the surface location.
OCS P-0202 unnamed offshore oil field
An unnamed field is located 31/6 miles off Point Hueneme in Federal OCS P-0202. The field was discovered in July(?) 1969 by a well drilled to a total depth of 8,452 feet. It flowed 15.8°-gravity oil at a rate of about 1,000 bpd from a depth of about 5,000 feet (Californa Oil World, 1969, v. 62, no. 7 [13]).
SUMMARY
Oil, tar, and gas have been features of the natural environment of the Santa Barbara Channel region for thousands of years; petroleum has been the chief mineral resource of the region for decades.
In 1968, the oil fields of the channel area produced 22.9 million barrels of oil, about 6 percent of California's production. Cumulative oil production at the end of 1968 for these fields was about 1.1 billion barrels, or about 71/6 percent of California's cumulative production. Dry gas production for the offshore gas fields in 1968 was about 12 percent of the State production, and their cumulative production was about 5 percent
of the State total.

94025 Island Park is a topographic basin of compound origin related to the three rhyolitic cycles of the Yellowstone Plateau volcanic field. Big Bend Ridge, the southwestern rim of Island Park, bounds a segment of the first-cycle caldera, which formed by collapse during the Huckle berry Ridge Tuff eruption 1.9 m.y. ago and which extended 90 km east ward into Yellowstone National Park. Thurmon Ridge, the northwestern rim of Island Park, bounds part of a second-cycle caldera 20 km across that formed 1.2 m.y. ago as a result of the Mesa Falls Tuff eruption and is nested within the older caldera. This collapse event reacti vated caldera faults on Big Bend Ridge. The rest of the first- and second-cycle calderas are buried by the third-cycle 0.6 m.y.-old Lava Creek Tuff and younger volcanic rocks. The eastern rim of Island Park is not a caldera scarp but is formed by large rhyolite flows of the third cycle. These flows all vented on the Madison Plateau farther east.
The youngest major rhyolitic eruptions at Island Park occurred about a million years ago. Subsequent solidification of the rhyolitic magma bodies that sustained the first two cycles allowed tectonic fracturing of the resulting plutons and eruptions of mantle-derived basaltic magma through the caldera floor during the last 300,000 years. Because no major silicic magma body now lies beneath Island Park, a high-tempera ture geothermal system similar to Yellowstone is not likely. The granitic plutons are still cooling, however, and a lower-temperature geothermal resource might exist at moderate depth.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2012,"ORIGIN AND GEOTHERMAL POTENTIAL OF ISLAND PARK, EAS'rERN IDAHO Christiansen, Robert L., U.S. Geological Survey, Menlo Park, CA 94025 Island Park is a topographic basin of compound origin related to the three rhyolitic cycles of the Yellowstone Plateau volcanic field.

Although temperatures near or in excess of 100° C were encountered in both holes, no significant quantities of thermal water were found, These results suggest'that further drilling at Old Maid Flat may have low probability of success. Detailed chemical and mineralogical analysis of well cuttings and surface outcrops allowed correlation of stratigraphic units. Analysis of samples of the Rhododendron Formation gave the first' comprehensive chemical and mineralogical characterization of this unit. At least, 183 m (600 ft) of a distinctive megacrystic two-pyroXene andesite unit (the Last Chance andesite), K-Ar dated at 10.7+0.5 m.y. B.P., overlies the Rhododendron Formation; the lower part of the Rhododendron Formation interfingers with Wanapum Basalt of the Columbia River Basalt Group. The Last Chance andesite is distinctly more mafic than most of the Rhododendron rocks and appears to be the first indication of a gradual shift to increasingly mafic volcanism which occurred in the latest Miocene. Eruption of small volumes of olivine basalt in the late Pliocene was the culmination of this overall trend toward more mafic volcanism. Intrusion of numerous biotite-bearing hornblende microquartz diorite sills (K-Ar age of 9.3+0,87 m:y,) into the Rhododendron Formation and older units occurred at roughly the same time as widespread laumontite-grade metamorphism and intrusion of large hornblende diorite plutons of the Laurel Hill (K-Ar ages of 11.6-8.0 m.y.) and Still Creek intrusions. Chemical coherence of the intrusives with the Rhododendron rocks suggests that they may be part of a genetically related magmatic series.","Atalasoft, Inc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These are:
1. The identification of new geothermal resources that are worth leasing.
2. The leasing of some sort of geothermal right to develop.
3. The drilling and testing of new resources to prove they are commercial.
4. The design and construction of the generating facilities.
5. The establishment of a market for the sale of the energy produced including a connection to the grid.
As you work your way through these 5 levels of activity you will meet much opposition. A number of these levels of activity will require permitting and bonding, and will involve public hearings. Attendees will largely be people without the faintest idea of what you are talking about, but most of",Exploration – The Identification of a Possible Resource,"The identification of new resources to exploit is the first big stumbling block. Potential resource identification is the task of a geothermal explorationist. The problem is the lack of skilled manpower. The geothermal industry offers little incentive for the development of such expertise at present. Geothermal exploration in the U.S. is, for all practical purposes, a dead profession. The industry, if it is to prosper and grow, must progress beyond drilling hot springs, analogous to the early oil industry’s drilling at oil seeps and address the issue of providing enough interest in prospect identification to encourage young people with the right kind of inquiring minds to gain the needed education and field experience, whether by establishing scholarships or providing funds for noted geothermal explorationists to devote a year to teaching at selected universities.
For a new startup company there are two initial criteria to be met. The first is to include an explorationist in the startup group. The second is to scrape up enough money to fund the initial fieldwork and indoor interpretive work that enables making the decision that a resource may actually be present at a site being studied. This money is usually “family and friends” money.
A different approach to exploration formerly existed in the hard mineral business. This was the time when hard mineral companies and even a few utilities had exploration subsidiaries whose sole job was to find new deposits. Thus Kennecott had Bear Creek Mining, Anaconda had International Smelting, Keevil Mining (now TechCominco) had Inter-American
4",Austin and Austin,"Resources and so on. If any of the 4 major geothermal operating companies in the U.S. or any of the big utilities have exploration subsidiaries out seeking major deposits such as a new Big Geysers, they have kept them well hidden. The First Barrier to Expanding the Geothermal Industry is a Lack of Skilled Explorationists.","The Leasing of Some Sort of Geothermal Right to Develop, That Hopefully Has Some Degree of Exclusivity Attached","The exploration activity has identified a geographical location that warrants serious study. Several activities should now take place concurrently. A contract is let with the greenest environmental data base group you can get your hands on to do an initial environmental evaluation of the site of interest. You want a green group so your data will be acceptable to the environmental community. At the same time you do a careful analysis of all of the potential stakeholders at the location of interest– hunters, recreationists, mountain bikers, ski mobilers, hot springs worshippers, local business interests, Native Americans, NIMBY groups, politicians, regulators, civic groups, development groups, chambers of commerce, environmentalist groups, ranchers and so on. From this analysis you prepare a briefing schedule to be implemented the moment the word gets out you are leasing in the area. At the same time, you are preparing your preliminary land status maps – who owns what, or at least appears to. You try to determine what is severed estate, private with geothermal rights, Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Forest Service (USFS), Bureau of Reclamation, industrially owned, State owned, Federal acquired, failed Carey Act repurchase, mining claim occupancy parcels, Indian reservations, withdrawn, Area of Critical Environmental Concern (ACEC), roadless wilderness, wilderness study area, railroad, and all the other ownership oddities you may be forced to deal with. Speaking of wilderness, part of the Coso KGRA in California is now in a roadless wilderness area and the sign informing one of this is posted in the middle of a mine access road. Even more incredible is the placing of the Randsburg geothermal prospect in a wilderness. As you put this ownership mix onto paper, remember Hunt’s First Law of Mineral Deposits (4), as rephrased for the geothermal industry. “ Many mountains contain valuable geothermal deposits and developers have found it useful to have their power development projects close to the deposits. Conversely, power development projects that are not close to the deposits are not very satisfactory.” You have your land picked out and prioritized. You think you have figured out what sort of rights each surface parcel may have. You hire a skilled land man who can speak the local lingo, has a sweet gift of gab, can empathize with the irate rancher who had a bad experience with some oil company 30 years ago when they tore up his wheat field and never came back to clean up their mess and you turn your land man loose to get your leasing underway. You now need money. Money for leases. Money to pay the land man, and most irritating of all, money for bonding in perpetuity, or at least until you get tired of it all and give up and go home. You can generally get this far with “family and friends” money. Using Idaho (the home of Idatherm LLC) for our example, State land is the simplest to lease. You have some degree of confidence the state actually owns the development rights and the paper work is simple and fast. For some obscure reason the state only leases one section blocks, so if you want to lease 15 sections you will have 15 leases, 15 sets of forms to fill out, 15 lease payments to make, and 15 bonds, tying up $30K for as long as you stay in business. This may be a minor piece of change for the XYZ Super Oil Company but it is a definite hurdle for the little entrepreneur. Where you have severed estates and lease from the surface owner, the BLM may act fairly fast for the first lease or two, but they quickly lose interest if you are not out there drilling immediately, and your leasing campaign winds up on the back burner or worse. We have known the BLM to tell a small company that any lease application they make will be automatically declared a KGRA even if they are the only applicant, which stopped this little company dead in its tracks. You gerrymander your surface title acquisition so that you can slant drill much of the BLM ground, avoiding vast reams of NEPA documents and keeping the public hearings to a minimum. If you want surface occupancy, the time from lease application to lease granting by the BLM in the western US averages 9 years. We know of one lease application that sat on a BLM desk for over 20 years. The problem of lease processing delays is the subject of considerable discussion at the Washington level today, yet at the state level the lack of funding for lease processing and the lack of personnel continues. Forest Service land is misery – not only are you dealing with the BLM who does the USFS leasing but you are also dealing with the USFS, an agency that has its own agendas and mineral development is not one of them. The BLM will routinely point out that if you want them to move in your lifetime, you can pay for the work they are supposed to be doing. Despite occasional fine words at the Washington political level, leasing Federal land ranges from time consuming to essentially impossible and geothermal energy development does not appear to be of much interest to the BLM. If you hope to do something involving surface access on Federal lands you can expect leasing to take years. You, too, will learn that delay is the most deadly form of denial. A special case worth note is when one begins to suspect that insurmountable public and governmental opposition is beginning to form with respect to a given prospect. With the large number of undeveloped geothermal deposits in the western U.S., in the past the senior author has had occasion to examine over 700 such prospects for a Canadian client, it seems preposterous for a company to fixate on trying to bull its way through years of increasingly costly litigation and permitting. It would seem far better, both financially and from the standpoint of the public’s perception of the industry, to pick up one’s marbles and head to a new site where the local folks and governments are friendly. One thing the state lands give you is a reasonable assurance of the exclusive right to develop. The BLM generally, but not always, knows what they own. DOD lands are subject to different rules, not the BLM’s. Here in Idaho if your prospect includes a
5 mixture of severed estates, BLM lands, State lands, and private lands, do not forget that each little drop of geothermal fluid magically changes from mineral to sui generis when it crosses the BLM-private or BLM-State boundary, and you can only lease the right of access from the private land owner, not the resource itself. If your prospect is half in Idaho and half in another state, the surface owner in the other state may actually own part of the geothermal resource. There are all sorts of water laws to deal with as well, depending on what you do with the fluids produced. You probably need a lawyer now. The Second Barrier to Geothermal Development is the Complexity of Land and Resource Ownership Coupled with the Difficulty and Lengthy Delays Encountered When One Attempts to Lease Federal Lands",The Drilling and Testing of New Resources to Prove They Are Capable of Commercial Production,"Someplace between leasing and setting out to drill your first hole, you will learn more about land use planning than you cared to know. In this country it is vaguely sinful to leave something not covered by a plan. The fact that such plans are an impediment to progress and have little touch with reality is immaterial. The planning process keeps a vast number of bean counters employed. The senior author will never forget a meeting in Washington DC during the Vietnam War when an executive of a major company got up at a planning review meeting and stated: “If planning will win the war, we have already won it!” at which point he walked out of the meeting. The first thing one has to realize is that, since no one knew a geothermal resource might be present, its development is not included in the land use plan, be it city, county, BLM or USFS. The next thing you find out is that the plan was just adopted and it will not be updated or rewritten for several years, and since the agency folks who wrote it have both tremendous pride of authorship and no incentive to make any changes anyhow, getting changes or modifications to allow your geothermal project to proceed will be a very real challenge. Assuming your project spans two counties and two Federal agencies (the state generally does not care), you will have at least 4 plans to deal with, all created with different terms and time lines. You set out to choose a drill site for the first hole. You have done a lot of geology on the ground and intricate satellite photo annotation and you bought some oil company’s geophysics run 20 years ago, and you know where you want to drill. You know where the hole should be, but putting it there is out of the question for aesthetic reasons, deer migration reasons, a threatened frog in a bog, a wetland designated years ago that is still on the maps but is all dry sagebrush, a chipping site is too close, someone thinks a goshawk may want to nest nearby, you are too close to a property line even though you have both properties under lease, or something or other, so you settle for a drill site that is second or third best. Your choice of a drill site will also be driven by royalty requirements. Private owners are generally reasonable. The BLM, when you finally figure out their royalty provisions (5), will collect about 3-1/2 percent unless you are a binary plant, which, if you do it right, can be run royalty free. Idaho state lands are a flat 10 percent. State land is easiest to lease but the last you want to produce. You get the site engineered and check the design with the depths to bedrock and get preliminary bids for pad preparation and drilling. Now comes the crunch. You are now beyond “family and friends” money. You are looking for several million in venture capital. You are stalled until you can find the money. All sorts of capital groups call you to assure you that once the first hole is drilled successfully, they will be happy to finance you, but finding someone willing to finance the first hole or two will take months to years. Part of the problem stems from the fact that the financial types want you to have a power sales agreement, and the utilities want you to guarantee delivery but, until you drill, you do not know what your resource is. While you are trying to establish a power purchase agreement that will not bankrupt you, you will probably also spend about a year or so negotiating access to a transmission line. You go to companies that have succeeded in the past. They have explored, taken risks and have been successful and are now milking a vast cash cow. Management has gone from entrepreneurial to bean counting, being largely run by bookkeepers. If they want to expand, they may buy someone else’s cash cow, usually for sale because its health is a little dubious, but a bookkeeper can understand this sort of activity. Exploration is out, and decisions are now made by the “Prudence Committee”, which generally has no exploration experience at all, and is best called the “Wet Blanket Committee”. It should be noted that what is really needed is dry-hole money. You present some entity a drilling proposal and they either put up or guarantee the drilling costs. If the hole succeeds and the project works, they get paid back. If not, you are home free. The old defense minerals (DMEA) program was much like this, and enabled a lot of exploration work to be done. If the US government were actually serious about green power and renewable or alternate energy, which seems rather dubious, there would be a loan guarantee program for initial drilling. While you hunt for funding, permits expire, water rights have to be renewed, new environmental restrictions are enacted, the cost of casing goes up by leaps and bounds, rigs become hard to find and experienced rig crews even harder. Assuming you do find the money sooner or later, the last act before drilling is to bond the operation. This can be really expensive. In Idaho the bonding required at present by the Department of Water Resources makes one wonder if they have any real interest in geothermal power. In fact, Idaho State Lands suggest you drill as an oil and gas wildcat, as their rules are pretty reasonable. Then if you make a geothermal discovery, you convert to geothermal which falls under the Department of Water Resources. The Third and Greatest Barrier to Developing New Geothermal Resources is Money. Assuming You Eventually Deal Successfully With the Conflicts and Delays Associated With Land Use Planning, and the High and Uncertain Costs of Bonding, the Inability to Raise Venture Capital for the First Two or Three Drill Holes is the Greatest Single Barrier to Expanding the Geothermal Industry Today

6",The Design and Construction of the Generating Facilities,"The design and construction of the generating facilities and transmission lines is a straightforward engineering and construction project once you have detailed well test data in hand. A permitting problem may exist for the first wells to be tested because of a need to discharge to the atmosphere even though plant operation may entail no such discharges. This means great care in not allowing the sights, sounds and odors of testing to turn a local populace against the industry or the specific plant. This is especially true if the produced non-condensable gases are quite sour. The type of plant to be built must match the local situation. Plant location may need to be in a gully or canyon rather than on a slope or ridgeline in order to comply with visual requirements. The plant may need to be combined cycle or binary so as to be air-cooled, an especially important aspect in a critically water short state such as Idaho. If stringent emission requirements are in place, then the binary with its closed loop use of fluids may be the only legally feasible route to go. In Idaho, high temperature geothermal fluids are not subject to water rights, so this potential problem is generally minimal (6) but if the geothermal operation interferes with some near by water right, then the Department of Water Resources has the ability to order a shutdown of the plant. A serious problem can occur if hot springs are modified by geothermal production or injection, because hot springs are a powerful psychological symbol to a great many people. In the state of Idaho, if the geothermal fluid is used for “water” after having the heat extracted, then a water right must be sought. Uncertainties lie in the area of building permits, zoning, general plans and impacts on scenic vistas, wildlife issues and the like. In some states the current time to achieve all the permits for a geothermal power plant is measured in years, with a misstep in the permitting process putting one into an endless loop. Some jurisdictions specify the minimum spacing that must exist between generating units in order to comply with small power plant exemptions. This simply results in added expense and inefficiency in the use of the resource and the operation of the plants. All these uncertainties add to the time and cost of raising money, even after the first successful wells are drilled and tested. Once construction financing is in hand the smell of money floats out on the breezes. Financial vultures, ranging from individuals to utilities will start to stalk the project – hoping to force you to sell out cheaply or to manipulate you for their own gain. If you have a really difficult fluid to deal with, it pays one to consider the words of a senior official with Kerr McGee Chemical at the time Salton Sea was first being explored. He stated: “The first company to try to develop a new process to cope with a difficult resource will go broke, it is better to be the second or third to try to make the place work.” Many a deposit will be inherently difficult or “not quite” economic. Just because you happen to be the owner at the moment does not mean you have to go broke trying to develop the place. Unless you have a truly unique and wonderful process to employ, it is far better to select a more auspicious site and let someone else do the struggling. The Fourth Barrier to Geothermal Development is Seen in the Impact of Complex Permitting, Planning and Zoning Restrictions on Plant Construction Combined With the Actions of Financial Vultures",The Formal Identification of a Market,"Market establishment, including negotiating access to the grid, is truly a high art form. You will probably be dealing with a utility that is a monopoly in its service area. Municipal utilities may prove simpler to deal with legally but they are intensely political. You may be dealing with organizations struggling with financial survival themselves. Worst of all, electricity is a social welfare instrument of intense political importance. Generally the PUC makes the political decisions that can make or break a small company. A major drive in some states is the fulfillment of green power portfolios or, as in Idaho, the staving off of the creation of such, which means you are the pawn in someone else’s game. The Locking Up of an Actual Market is a Procedure That Is Best Described as a High Political Art Form, Involving the PUC, Utilities, City Councils, Politicians, Environmental Activists and Social Activists. The Difficulty in Establishing a Firm Equitably Priced Market is the Fifth Great Barrier to Expanding the Geothermal Industry in the United States.",Summary,"In summary we can list the main barriers present today. These are: 1. A lack of trained explorationists. 2. A general inability to lease Federal lands on a timely basis in combination with inimical land use plans in virtually all jurisdictions. 3. The greatest single barrier today – the inability to raise venture capital for the drilling of the first few wells at any new geothermal site. 4. Conflicting planning, zoning, bonding and permitting issues. 5. A confusing and intensely political market place. The geothermal industry has a very limited resource base today. New deposits are not being explored because there is insufficient interest on the part of the government, the utilities or the industry itself at this time. There is no venture capital for high risk initial drilling, and there is no dry hole money. Only a zealot or a masochist belongs in the resource acquisition and exploration end of the geothermal industry today.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Needed: A New Approach to Exploration Management,,III B.

High-temperature geothermal system are found in tectonically and volcanically active areas, such as in SW-China (Wang et.al., 1995). Low- to medium-temperature systems of the convective type, where the geothermal water has circulated to great depths to mine the heat, are mostly found in tectonically active areas, with above average geothermal gradients, such as in SE-China. Other low-temperature geothermal systems are found in major sedimentary basins, in particular in E and NE-China.
The Tanggu geothermal reservoir is situated in the North China Sedimentary Basin. It is located in the District of Tanggu, on the coast of the Bohai Bay in Tianjin in NE-China (Figure 1). Tanggu District has
I opulation of about 450.000 and is located 120 km E of Beijing and 50km east of Tianjin City. ggu City, a major seaport and industrial area, is a
art of Tanggu District, with a population of pproximately 360.000. Since 1987 twenty three
cessful production wells have been drilled in the field. The majority of these wells is used for ng hot water, mostly for space heating.

hot water production has caused the water level he geothermal system to drop by 40-50m. At ;ent it declines at a rate of 3-4 m per year, which been a matter of increasing concern for the ties producing from the field. The question has en whether the geothermal reservoir may be rexploited.
Tanggu geothermal system has been iprehensively explored by the Tianjin )thermal Research and Development Institute 20). A part of that study was an assessment of the ,rvoir’s potential by the use of volumetric hods. Such methods, however, tend to restimate the potential of a geothermal resource can not be used to predict the response (water :1 decline, cooling) of a reservoir to production. y only provide a rough first estimate of a :rvoir’s potential. The only modeling carried out the Tanggu reservoir to date is the one presented long (1 996a).
s paper presents the principal results of a recent hrvoir evaluation for the Tanggu geothermal :rvoir (Axelsson, 1996). It constitutes a part of a thermal development project being undertaken by kir-Orkint Consulting Group of Iceland (VO), on
one hand, and the Tanggu Geothermal Office (TGO) and the local authorities in Tanggu, on the other hand. The principal purpose of the evaluation was to estimate the long-term production potential of the geothermal reservoir, by predicting the future waterlevel changes in the reservoir. The purpose was, therefore, partly to answer the question whether the geothermal reservoir is, or will become, overexploited. The reservoir assessment also addressed several other aspects of the management of the reservoir.
Geothermal reservoir engineering has become an integral part of the management of geothermal systems worldwide, and modeling studies constitute the most important tools of this discipline (Bodvarsson and Witherspoon, 1989; Steffinsson et.al., 1995). Therefore, the main part of the Tanggu reservoir evaluation involved the development of two simple models which have been used to simulate the water level decline in the geothermal system.
The paper is organized as follows: This general introduction is followed by a presentation of the drilling and production history of the Tanggu geothermal field, including a discussion of the response of the reservoir to production. Following this the two models developed for the reservoir are discussed. Consequently water level forecasts for different future production scenarios are presented, followed by a brief summary and recommendations regarding the future management of the reservoir.
PRODUCTION HISTORY
The Tanggu geothermal reservoir was discovered during intensive oil-exploration drilling in the eighties, and the first geothermal well in the field was drilled by the BOHAI oil-company in 1987. Presently twenty three successful production wells have been drilled into the Guantao formation. Some information on these wells is presented in Table 1 and the locations of the wells are shown in Figure 2. These wells are drilled and operated by several different companies or enterprises. The wells range in depth from 1450m to 2200m and the discharge temperatures from 60” to 74°C. Most of the wells are utilized for space heating, except a few which are utilized for various other purposes (recreation, fishfarming, etc.).
During the official heating season, from the middle of November till late March, pumps with capacities
about 35 I/s are installed in most of the wells (VO Insulting Group, 1994). For the rest of the year ich smaller pumps, for tap water production, are talled. Since well TR-1 was drilled, the hot water )duction has been steadily increasing, from about 3,000 tons in 1988 to 5 million tons in 1995. The :rage monthly production from the Tanggu ervoir is presented in Figure 3. The production s about 100 l/s during the winter of 1988/1989, but iched almost 310 l/s during the winter of 9511996. The production is more or less constant ring each heating season, because speed controlled mps and automatic controls are lacking.

hot water is mostly used for space heating (Cao, Zheng and Cao, 1995). During the 1995/1996
season about 720.000m2 of living space
were heated by geothermal energy, and the heated area will probably have increased by 200.000 m2 at the end of 1997, or by almost 30 %. The hot water for this increase will mostly be provided by wells TR-21, 22 and 23. It must be pointed out, however, that at the return water temperatures prevalent in Tanggu (45-5OoC), the production during the 1995/1996 heating season must only have partly met the heating demand of those 720,000m2. The district heating systems in Tanggu are operated separately, i.e. one system per well (VO Consulting Group, 1994). Only a few of the pumps currently in use are fitted with speed converters for controlling the well production. These aspects seriously impede the optimization of geothermal utilization in Tanggu.
The hot water extraction has caused the water level in the geothermal system to drop by 40-50m since 1987, which is the most pronounced production induced response seen in the Tanggu reservoir. The water level in most production wells drops, of course, even more during production. During the 1995/1996 heating season the water level in production well TR-4, which is centrally located, fell to a depth of 80m. The water level continues to decline at a rate of 3-4 m per year, which has been a

RESERVOIR POTENTIAL
The simple models were consequently used to estimate the production potential of the Tanggu geothermal reservoir. This was done by calculating water level forecasts for different future production scenarios, since the production response of the reservoir is chiefly manifested as water level drawdown. Both the lumped and distributed models simulate the water level decline in the Tanggu reservoir quite accurately. Yet, since the geometry and properties of the distributed model are in a very good agreement with the geological conditions in the geothermal system, the distributed parameter model was considered more reliable.
A maximum allowable draw-down determines the production potential. Specifying such a lower limit is not straight-forward, however, but was done on the basis of several criteria: Firstly, on the basis of the setting depths of well pumps. Even though, many of the pumps presently in use in Tanggu have a maximum setting depth of less than 80m, there are pumps produced in China, with maximum setting depths of 100 - 200 m. Secondly, by the design of the production wells. Some of the earlier Tanggu wells are cased with a 13 318"" pump pipe, down to 150 m only. Thirdly, by the danger of colder water inflow, and hence cooling of the reservoir. This danger is considered minimal, but increases rapidly with increasing draw-down. The fourth criteria is set by land subsidence. It is considered unlikely, however, that some increase in production will influence the subsidence seriously.
Based on the above considerations, as well as the nature of the Tanggu reservoir, the maximum
I I
llowable draw-down will here be set at 150m th. Therefore, the reservoir should sustain some ease in production. Extending the limit much her, however, is not warranted at this stage. In
future, if the draw-down in the reservoir roaches this limit and a re-evaluation allows, the mit may be extended to a greater depth and the otential of the Tanggu reservoir revised. It should e mentioned that the pressure or water level draw-
, during production, is quite variable in other ermal systems in the world. In Iceland, for arison, it varies from practically zero in highly
e systems with sufficient recharge to more m in poorly permeable geothermal systems
ater level predictions were calculated for four ent production scenarios: First a scenario (I)
the 199511996 production is maintained for next ten years, i.e. an average yearly production
0 I/s with a heating season average production 0 Us. Secondly a scenario (11) where all the ilable wells have been put into full use in 1998, this case the average production increases to
s, or by 125% and the maximum production ses to 580 lls, or by 90%. The predictions for cases, calculated by the distributed model, are
nted in Figure 6, which shows the water level in 1 TR-10. The water level in well TR-4 may be ected to be about 20 m below the water level in 1 TR-IO. This can be seen in Figure 7, which ws the water level in well TR-4, again calculated the distributed model. The water level in other
ction wells is in most cases expected to be than the water level in TR-4, in particular in wells which are located some distance from the ter of the well field.
se figures show that for scenario I, the water level he geothermal system will stay above 65 - 70 m, reas the water level in production wells will stay ve 90 - 100 m. For scenario 11, the water level in geothermal system will drop to 110 - 125 m, eas the water level in production wells will e to 135 - 155 m.
on these results the production potential of the ggu reservoir is estimated to be about 10 million
per year, or about 320 11s on the average for the t ten years. The maximum production for shorter
ds (few weeks) should not exceed 550 11s. The oir is clearly not overexploited, but this tial estimate assumes utilizing well pumps with
he older parts of the Icelandic crust.
L
setting depths of at least 150m. It must be kept in mind, however, that the operational costs of pumps increases rapidly with increasing depth, which may set an economical limit to the maximum draw-down. The estimated potential of the Tanggu reservoir is based on predictions for the coming ten years only. The maximum pump setting depth and hence the reservoir potential should be revised on a regular basis in the future, i.e. every five years.
Water level predictions were calculated for two additonal production scenarios which assume that drastic measures will be taken during the next 5 years to improve the energy efficiency of space heating in Tanggu. These involve: 1) integrating the separate district heating systems into one system, with improved distribution system insulation, 2 ) installing speed controlled pumps in all wells, and
improving the indoor heating systems by xeasing radiator size and installing automatic ntrols. Principally these measures would result in a % reduction in hot water consumption per unit ating area. The results are presented in Figure 8. -st considered is a scenario where the currently ated living space (720,000m’) is not assumed to :rease during the next ten years (scenario 111). This )uld keep the water level in the geothermal system :I1 above 6 0 m (TR-lo), and above 9 0 m in sduction wells. Secondly a scenario where the othermally heated area increases in steps during 5 next ten years, from 720,000 m2 to 1,320,000 m2, by 83% (scenario IV). This would cause the water {el in the geothermal system to decline to a depth about 9 0 m , and the water level in production :lls to about 120m depth, by the end of the :diction period. In spite of this great increase in ated area, this would still be well above the aximum allowable draw-down of 150 m, used to timate the potential of the reservoir

e-injection will counteract the water-level drawIwn to some degree, and hence increase the .eduction potential of the Tanggu geothermal rstem. This was studied in detail during the servoir evaluation (Axelsson, 1996). The results dicate that to achieve a significant benefit the rejection must be a substantial part of the production. herefore, several re-injection wells are required, at ast 4 - 8 wells. This will increase the production itential of the Tanggu reservoir by 10 to 20%. ccording to the distributed model re-injection wells ust be drilled relatively close to production wells to
achieve a maximum benefit. Too short a distance, however, will cause an untimely thermal breakthrough and cooling of production wells. Calculations indicate that a minimum distance of 1000 m is required. A re-injection test is already under way in Tanggu (Dong, 1996b).
CONCLUDING REMARKS
The Tanggu geothermal system is an extensive, highly permeable, horisontal sandstone reservoir, bounded to the west by the Cangdong fault. The depth to the reservoir varies from 1500 to 2200 m and it’s thickness is between 60 to 9 0 m . The reservoir temperature ranges from 64 to 78°C. Twenty three successful wells have been drilled in an area exceeding 300 km2. A simple model, which simulates the geology of the reservoir, as well as it’s reponse to production, has been developed. The principal result of the reservoir evaluation for the Tanggu geothermal reservoir is that it’s production potential is about twice the current production. This study also resulted in several recommendations regarding the future management of the reservoir, listed below:
A comprehensive reservoir management programme must be designed and implemented for the Tanggu geothermal reservoir. This should, of course, be a cooperative undertaking of the different companies utilizing the field.
Even though this evaluation indicates that the production potential of the Tanggu reservoir is about twice the current production, the production from the field should be increased slowly in steps. At each step the response of the reservoir should be evaluated and it’s potential revised.
The most important reservoir management action which can be taken in Tanggu would be to improve the energy efficiency of the space heating as already discussed. The resulting reduction in hot water consumption would result in some water level recovery and reduced operational costs, if the heating area remains constant. It may also make it possible to double the present heating area, without surpassing the production potential of the geothermal reservoir, and hence double the revenue from space heating. Such improvements constitute, of course, a major undertaking for the companies
involved, but this may be carried out in small steps during a longer period.
The combined yield of the 23 wells, drilled so far in Tanggu, exceeds the estimated production potential of the reservoir. It is therefore recommended that no new wells be drilled in the area. If the separate district heating systems are integrated into one system, some of the existing wells may be used as re-injection or back-up wells. If more production wells are nevertheless drilled in the area, they should be located more than 2 km away from other production wells.
Re-injection is potentially a very important management operation in the Tanggu field, since it will counteract the water level decline. The reinjection test currently under way in Tanggu must be continued. A tracer test should be carried out concurrently with the re-injection, principally to confirm the current model of the reservoir (Axelsson et.al., 1995).
Monitoring in Tanggu needs significant improvement, particularly in view of the foreseeable increase in production during the next few years. Monitoring data is the basis of modeling studies, and evaluations, such as the one presented here.
Since the two simple models, used in the reservoir evaluation, simulate the geothermal reservoir fairly accurately, they should suffice as management tools for the Tanggu reservoir in the coming years. In the future, however, as more data become available, a detailed numerical model for the Tanggu reservoir should be developed.

INTRODUCTION,"Proven reserves are used in the oil & gas industry to provide a measure of the financial value of a resource-based asset. In the hydrocarbon producing business, the unit of reserves is the commodity which is sold – barrels of oil or standard cubic feet of natural gas. While the details of ownership & contract configuration in the geothermal business vary, ultimately the corresponding commodity sold is electricity.
In the oil & gas business, proved reserves are derived for a variety of commercial purposes, including regulatory requirements for external reporting to a government agency such as the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), investors, financing from external organizations, and performance management. They are generally governed by standards and regulations, and consequently the results are usually considered to be credible.
In the geothermal business matters are at a less mature state of development, and consequently the results may be less credible. Grant (2000) has provided an overview of
geothermal reserves as part of a review of methods for determining the values. Sanyal and Sarmiento (2005) provided an expanded discussion of geothermal reserves as part of presenting proved reserves results for four Philippine fields. Clotworthy et al. (2006) proposed a starting point for the development of geothermal reserves determination based on mining and oil & gas standards. In 2008 the Australian Geothermal Code Committee published a framework (the “Australian Code”) for reporting the results of geothermal exploration, testing and development (The Australian Geothermal Code Committee, 2008; Ward et al., 2009.) This Australian Code was updated in 2010 (Australian Geothermal Energy Group, 2012). While use of the Australian Code does not appear to be required by any regulatory agency, members of the Australian Geothermal Energy Association are required to use it when reporting the results of their activities.
This paper focuses narrowly on describing a framework for determining proved geothermal reserves, with the objective of establishing a clear and credible basis. The elements of this class of reserves are first presented, including definitions, steps and other considerations. Then methods for estimating such reserves for hydrothermal systems are discussed. The framework presented is consistent with both the Australian Code as well as the updated Petroleum Resources Management System sponsored by the SPE, AAPG, WPC and SPEE (SPE-PRMS, 2007.)",2 PROPOSED FRAMEWORK,The following describes a proposed framework for developing values of proved geothermal reserves.,2.1 Criteria for proved reserves,"Define proven geothermal reserves as the electricity that can be generated and sold with reasonable certainty over the project life. Commonly used units are Mega Watt-hour, [MWh] . The value of proved geothermal reserves reported will have the following underlying elements:
• The quantity is an estimate made with reasonable certainty;
• The quantity is based on: o existing technology, o expected operating conditions, o realistic operating efficiency based on experience, o current economic conditions, or those that are
projected with reasonable certainty, o a valid sales contract, o the existence of required approvals from
regulatory bodies, and o financial commitment from the commercial entity
that owns the project;
• Total field net generation corresponding to the time frame of any sales contract at the committed MW capacity, unless this cannot be assured with reasonable certainty. A typical value is 30 years. If such an
New Zealand Geothermal Workshop 2012 Proceedings 19 - 21 November 2012 Auckland, New Zealand
amount of total net generation cannot be determined with reasonable certainty, the value is based on a shorter period.
• The value is based on the information available on a specified date, and the generation expected from this “as-of” date forward.
The discussion in this paper is for the case where a resource has been characterized and a commercial entity has not yet begun to generate and sell electricity. Sometimes reserves assessments are made for an operating project – in this case the underlying elements would be adjusted appropriately.
Either of two standards of certainty may be used:",2.1.1 Deterministic,"For proved reserves, there is “reasonable certainty” that the value determined can be achieved. For comparison, probable reserves are defined as “as likely as not” to be achieved, and possible reserves as “possible but not likely.”",2.1.2 Probabilistic,"For proved reserves, based on credible analysis, there is a 90% likelihood that the actual value achieved will be greater than or equal to value determined. This is commonly annotated as the P90 value. For comparison, probable reserves are defined as the P50 value and possible reserves as the P10 value.
The United States SEC has recently allowed for the use of probabilistic methods to oil and gas estimate reserves, in particular if the reserves estimate is project-based (Lee, 2009.)",2.2 Define the project and commercial entity,Proved reserves are determined based on a defined project occurring within the framework of a commercial entity. Both the project and commercial entity need to be clearly defined.,2.3 Define the date of reporting,"Proved reserves are based on a defined as-of date and only the information available on that date. While details will depend on the project, a common date corresponds to the end of the accounting reporting date for the commercial entity.",2.4 Define the project output profile,"Figure 1 presents an idealized probable project generation profile, during which there is i) rapid ramp-up of generation
as the field is brought on-line, ii) constant generation for some period of time, and iii) declining generation which terminates some time later when the plant is decommissioned.
In Figure 2 an idealized generation profile that can be expected with reasonable certainty is overlain on top of the probable profile. This generation follows the probable profile for a period of time and then drops to zero. If the project has a sales agreement that is based on a specified average generation level for a given period of time, this might be represented by the “reasonable certainty” curve if the field is able to provide the needed geothermal fluid.
Depending on the sales agreements of the project, it may be possible to have a declining generation profile which can be demonstrated to be economic. In this case, an alternate generation profile with reasonable certainty such as that shown in Figure 3 would be used or acceptable. The alternate profile in Figure 3 has the same total generation as the “reasonable certainty” profile in Figure 2.
As indicated above, the specific project profile to be determined will depend on what stage the project is in.",2.5 Determine and apply the method used to compute project output profile,"The next step is to review all of the available data and decide on the method of analysis to be used in determining the cumulative generation of the project profile that meets the standard of certainty on the reserves reporting date. Section 2 provides an overview of methods commonly used to do this.

The information and results used as input into the analysis needs to be sufficiently well documented and organized so that an independent reviewer could, in principle, repeat the analysis. Even though there may be a team involved in developing different elements of a reserves analysis, the results should be attributable to a single individual. This person is called the ‘Competent Person’ in the Australian Code (Ward et al, 2009) and the ‘Reserves Estimator’ in the SPE-PRMS (2007).
Four different kinds of information typically make up the inputs to proved reserves values, as reviewed in the following.","An assessment of the risk of curtailed power generation based on noncompliance of field activities and reservoir performance needs to be made, to the extent that the operation of the field is conditionally dependent on regulatory agency approvals. In many countries this might be based on environmental factors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The author gratefully acknowledges reviews of this paper provided by Mike Barnes of Mighty River Power and Malcolm Grant.,ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS,"A proved geothermal reserve is a single value of generation that can be sold from a defined project with high confidence as of a specified date and for which the project has a positive net present value.
A framework has been presented for the determination of such a value which is consistent with standards used in the oil and gas industry and also with the Australian Geothermal Code. The steps required for this determination are discussed, with elaboration of various requirements and considerations.
Finally an overview of the four main determination methods was presented, with observations on the requirements for their application so that the computed results meets the required standard of certainty.",4 SUMMARY,"Decline curve analysis is an accepted method for determining proved oil or gas reserves and commonly applied to single wells which are the only take points in a reservoir. This method of analysis is also commonly applied to geothermal wells for purposes of estimating future makeup wells in the field. It has also been applied to major groupings of power plants at The Geysers (Goyal and Box, 2004.) While there do not appear to be any published reports of the use of this method to determine proved reserves, the method may be appropriate if the right circumstances apply. These are primarily that there are no step-changes in the surface or reservoir conditions that impact well performance.",3.4 Decline curve projections,"Two different kinds of volumetric calculations are used to estimate resource capacity: those based on the heat in-place and those based on mass in-place.
Use of Monte Carlo methods applied to a heat in-place calculation for determination of proved reserves has been reported by Sanyal and Sarmiento (2005). A subsequent review of the method as applied to resource estimation in general emphasizes the need to use actual field data when defining the reservoir parameters (Garg and Combs, 2010.)
New Zealand Geothermal Workshop 2012 Proceedings 19 - 21 November 2012 Auckland, New Zealand
This is particularly true of the recovery factor parameter that is used in these calculations.
Various recent estimates of appropriate values of recovery factor have been made. Sanyal et al. (2002) apply a numerical calculation using analytic and Monte Carlo methods to general parameters estimated for geothermal reservoirs associated with volcanic systems to derive recovery factors of 0.05 to 0.10. Sanyal et al. (2004) use a semi-empirical calculation to estimate recovery factors in the kinds of hydrothermal systems assessed in USGS Circular 790 (Muffler, 1979), which included 37 fields in California, Utah and Nevada. They report that the resulting recovery factors are in the range 0.03 to 0.17 and with a mean of 0.11 and standard deviation of 0.08. They additionally report that this mean is close to a recovery factor of 0.131 which would make the original USGS estimates for these fields essentially the same as more recent estimates of their resource base. Finally, Williams (2007) has estimated recovery factors for three operating geothermal fields in the United States and concluded that care is needed in order to use consistent techniques when estimating the volumes and fracture porosities of the reservoirs.
With the exception of the three fields reported by Williams, there do not appear to be any published estimates of recovery factors for fields with a long operating history and based on data specific to a field. Thus, while calculations with the volumetric heat in-place method do generate a range of resource estimates from which a P90 value can be extracted, it is difficult to see how they are able to meet the required standard of certainty that this is a highly likely outcome.
Parini and Riedel (2000) have reported on a methodology that uses a mass in-place volumetric method to estimate a range of generating capacities for a field and can be used to estimate proved reserves. In this method an idealized numerical model of the field is constructed which contains the key physical parameters affecting field performance. The model is then run many times, sampling all variables around which there is uncertainty, and from which multiple values of mass recovery are computed. In the example reported ten variables with defined uncertainty properties were used as input to the model runs. This allows for a relationship between the uncertain variables and the mass recovery factor to be defined. This is then used to estimate a probability distribution for electrical generating capacity, from which the P90, P50 and P10 values can be extracted.",3.3 Application of probabilistic methods to volumetric calculations,"The construction of a numerical model of a reservoir based on a conceptual model which integrates all available information is a common practice. Such models can be used for the determination of proved reserves if they appropriately incorporate the critical physical processes which will affect the long term performance of the wells feeding a power plant. Examples of such processes include:
• Vaporization of liquid contained in the less-permeable rock removed from the fractures that feed the wells.
• Heating of cooler recharge or injected fluids as they move to production wells.
• Deep hot recharge in response to net mass withdrawals. • Mass and heat transfer interaction between the highly
permeable zones that normally feed geothermal wells and the somewhat lower permeability remaining rock volume.
Confidence in the appropriateness of such physical processes in a model may be obtained by satisfactory calibration of field history for an operating field. Gaining the needed confidence for a field with no full-scale operating history is more challenging and places an increased burden on appropriately designed and executed geoscience and well evaluation studies.
The derivation of a deterministic value for proved reserves using numerical simulation is in principle straightforward – simply develop a numerical model with the appropriate level of confidence in the physical processes and then run it in forecasting mode under a range of operating conditions.
The development of probabilistic proved reserves using numerical simulation is similarly in principle straightforward – develop a sufficient number of equiprobable models which match the initial state and any operating history and incorporate realistic elements of the critical physical factors. And then run these models in forecasting modes. Doing this in practice is not straightforward and there do not appear to be any publications reporting on such work for operating geothermal fields. In the next section a method is described which uses an idealized numerical model of a reservoir in conjunction with the Monte Carlo method and a volumetric calculation to derive proved, probable and possible reserves.",3.2 Reservoir simulation,"In this method an attempt is made to identify a developed field with sufficient history and which has characteristics similar to the field being assessed. If such a field can be identified, an analysis of the power density of development is made, e.g. sustainable MWe for 30 years per km2 of thermal resource. This power density is then applied to the field being evaluated, with any appropriate adjustments for different reservoir temperature or plant specific steam consumption. As an example, Grant (1996, 2000) has presented the results of a power density analysis for various fields. Sarmiento and Björnsson (2007, p. 226) present power densities for various fields in Iceland and the Philippines but do not provide the quantitative basis for the Philippines fields.
The concept underlying this method is the idea that hydrothermal systems with similar characteristics will have similar power densities that are only weakly dependent on the area of the thermal system. For example, the Bulalo Field in the Philippines can be characterized as a relatively hot system with average temperature of 280 oC that was initially liquid-dominated but with the upper portion of the column at saturation conditions. Natural recharge has been less than net exploitation withdrawals, leading to the creation of a widespread two phase zone throughout most of the upper portion of the reservoir. The boiling which has occurred in the core reservoir in the fractures and matrix has led to a cooling of those rocks, which is a key underlying physical process allowing thermal energy to be extracted from the system. A second process of thermal energy extraction is through the heating of reinjected fluids. This reservoir has been described by Strobel (1993), Clemente and Villadolid-Abrigo, (1993) and Sta. Maria et al (1995), among others.
Another example of a field that may be used as an analogue is the Wairakei Field. The key characteristics of this field with an average initial temperature of perhaps 255 oC are that it has a high level of permeability, strong natural recharge and has not evolved a widespread and deep twophase zone with continuing decreases in pressure. Additionally, the history of the field and its performance has been well documented. The following brief summary has been derived from the discussion in Grant and Bixley (2011.) In contrast to Bulalo, the physics associated with thermal energy recovery at Wairakei are associated with the deep 260 oC recharge and the warming up of cooler lateral recharge that is natural and more recently also derives from reinjected fluids. While the field did initially develop twophase and vapor-dominated zones, these appear to have stabilized. This can be demonstrated by computing the average field enthalpy from the mass and energy profiles published for the field using data from Clotworthy (2001). From 1955 to 2000 the producing enthalpy averaged 1,110 kJ/kg, corresponding to saturated liquid water at 255 oC. The standard deviation was only 35 kJ/kg, indicating approximately stable behavior. An additional complicating factor in any evaluation of the power density of Wairakei is the observation that it is linked with the Tauhara Geothermal field, and estimates of the influx from Tauhara need to be made.
Once an appropriate analogue for the field under assessment has been found and evaluated, details of the two fields need to be reviewed and adjustments made to the analogue field power density for physical differences in the field under assessment, such as average reservoir temperature, specific steam consumption and land access issues.",3.1 Application of power density metric to analogue fields,"The objective of this section is to provide an overview of methods that can be used to determine proved reserves,
New Zealand Geothermal Workshop 2012 Proceedings 19 - 21 November 2012 Auckland, New Zealand
highlighting the important considerations in appropriate application.",3 OVERVIEW OF DETERMINATION METHODS,"A proved reserve value for a project is thus a single value, representing the electrical generation that a project is capable of producing and selling with a high degree of confidence after a specified date using information, technology and economics at the as-of date specified. Such proved reserves may be added to a company’s proved reserves ledger, intended to be removed only when they are sold. It is common to add supplemental proven reserves for a field to the ledger - for example, based on field performance, expansion of field limits or other new information. Occasionally it is also necessary to remove proved reserves for reasons other than sale – for example due to a downward revision based on field performance. However, this is to be avoided. The spirit within which the technical assessment of proved reserves is made is to determine the largest value that will assure with reasonable certainty that they will only be removed from the ledger as a result of sale.",2.7 The proved reserve value,"Finally, an analysis which demonstrates that the project has at least a positive net present value needs to be made using cost and price projections that meet the required standard of certainty. The details of such an analysis will depend on the business purpose of preparing the proved reserves assessment. In some cases a review of the business case for the project may be sufficient.",2.6 Demonstrate positive net present value,2.5.4 Regulatory conditions,"Project information about the conversion of the geothermal fluid into electricity is needed in order to derive proved
reserves. This involves both the design and expected operational efficiency of the surface facilities. Specifically, how much geothermal fluid is expected with reasonable certainty to be needed to generate each MWh of electricity sold over the lifetime of the project?
For example, the Wairakei Field mass, energy and generation history up to 2000 (Clotworthy, 2001) can be used to show that specific steam consumption at Wairakei during the period 1965-2000 averaged 7.0 tonnes of steam for each MWh of electricity generated. A similar analysis can be done for the Bulalo Field using annual steam production and generation rates (Clemente and VilladolidAbrigo, 1993; Benito et al., 2005) to show that for the period 1980-1992 an average of 9.2 tonnes of steam were produced for each MWh of electricity generated. These values are based on steam produced in the field rather than delivered to the power plant.
By comparison, a modern field with a single owner using triple-flash separation to take advantage of the high pressures associated with a high-temperature reservoir may only require 5.45 tonnes of steam for each MWh of electricity generated. In this case the steam basis is the effective flash to 12 bara separation pressure and the steam is that actually delivered to the power plant operating at design conditions and with no operational losses (Horie, 2009).",2.5.3 Surface gathering and conversion process,"For many projects the operator can in principle access the entire reservoir with wells. However, there are some circumstances where this is not practical. For example, this may be as a result of limited access to the needed surface area due to private ownership rights. It may also be a result of development occurring on the edge of a protected area such as a forest or park.
Figure 4 displays the total area, At, of a hypothetical geothermal resource that would typically be defined by measured temperatures in the core and perhaps at some edges. The rest of the boundary would be defined by geophysical methods or wells with no temperature or permeability. An access boundary is depicted, separating two areas of the resource - one with access, Aa, and one with no access, Ana.
At the simplest level of analysis, if wells could not be drilled across the access boundary, proved reserves for a project with access only to the area Aa would need to factor the total proved reserves for the resource by (Aa/At). Adjustments to such a calculation might be made, depending on the details of the conceptual model of the resource.",2.5.2 Reservoir and land access,Current best practice in geothermal reservoir assessment involves the development of a conceptual model that incorporates a broad range of geoscience and engineering data and analysis. A credible analysis of reserves requires a credible conceptual model. A proved reserves assessment needs to additionally include some level of evaluation of the mechanical integrity of project wells and the degree to which there is risk of well mechanical failure during the life of the project.,2.5.1 Subsurface,,Geothermal Energy Development in the Philippines: Country Update,,F.A.

It is not a mineral, however, so it does not come under the Mining Law; and rights pertaining to the development and usage cannot therefore be based on this law.
Geothermal power exists mostly in volcanic and hot spring areas, with practically the same quality and form as the hot spring. Development is similar to hot spring drilling so rights for possession and usage are obtained in accordance with the provisions of the Hot Spring Law. At present, applications for hot spring drilling are made to the governors, mayors, and other relevant officials of the various prefectures, cities, etc., before development can be carried out. However, because this law places great importance on the administrative control of the rights for usage of hot springs, these rights conform to and are included in the civil laws concerning land possession and usage rights.
Also, many geothermal power areas are within parks of great natural beauty and the development of geothermal power is thereby restricted by the Parks Law. Application must be made to the Director-General of Environment Agency in the case of national parks, and to the prefectural governors in the case of designated parks, for the collection and use of soil and rocks, the construction of new buildings, etc.
Many geothermal power development areas are also in national lands. Sales and leasing of these lands are mainly to the public or enterprises benefiting the public under the National Properties Law and the National Lands Law. Under the Forestry Law, deforestation is restricted even on private land.
In addition, geothermal electric power generation facilities are included as thermal power facilities under the Electricity Utility Industry Law. A developer of geothermal power who wishes to have an enterprise to supply electricity for other than his own use may have a contract to supply electric power wholesale to the Electric Power Co., transmit electricity to his own nearby businesses, supply steam only, have generating facilities built by the Electric Power Co., etc.
It is now necessary to establish a systematic organization to handle the above problems to promote the development and usage of geothermal power and to stabilize the question of right. For the present, however, a bill is being considered
to designate geothermal power development areas and to determine the developers.
INTRODUCTION
A bill for promoting the development. of geothermal resources is about to be submitted to the Diet in the form of a resolution by House members who are associated with the Geothermal Resource Development Council of the Liberal Democratic Party. The oil crisis originating from the Middle East conflict at the end of the year before last shook the roots of the economy of our country, showing that the reverse side of ""great Japan with economic power"" was in reality a ""great country for processing trade"" or a ""small country with few natural resources,"" and threatened an economic crisis devolving on energy resources in Japan.
It may well be said opportunely that both the government and civil circles, under such circumstances, have come to recognize more strongly the importance of promoting the development of the geothermal energy which exists abun-» dantly in this volcanic country; it is the fourth in rank with thermal power, hydraulic power and atomic power. In the past. the country enacted special laws for developing energy resources, and has assisted and protected their development. These included oil, natural gas, uranium ore, coal and others. As for the geothermal resource, however, there is currently no such special law for promoting its development and utilization. It is, therefore, indispensable for geothermal developers to have a special law enacted, whereby their rights are expressly defined and properly protected at the national level. It is a highly significant step forward to see a trend toward enacting a law for its development and utilization.
For developing an area where geothermal resources are latent, the investigation of right relationships between landowners and users, and investigation of indications on land surface, and so on are done first. Then, after completing basic investigations in geology, geophysics, geochemistry, and structural and survey drilling, investigations of location conditions and construction of a power plant are conducted in that order. There is a case where these are accomplished concurrently. Furthermore, for developing geothermal resources for electric power, examinations are repeated in every technical field such as geology, geophysical exploration. measurement, boring, machinery, electricity, environmental protection, and so on.
In general, many of the areas latent in geothermal re-
2421
sources are located in mountainous districts having volcanos and hot springs and also inside natural parks; therefore, coping with environmental problems is extremely important. Besides, sincethe rights relevant to geothermal development are neither clear nor stabilized at present, agreements and coexistences with nearby cities, towns and villages become
a major precondition.
Accordingly, in order to promote geothermal resource development without hindrance, it is necessary for the country to stabilize the rights of geothermal developers through registration. The geothermal right referred to in this symposium is generally conceived as something like ""a right to prospect and develop geothermal resource and ., utilize it for electric power and other purposes. There is no such right firmly established in our current legal system; nor is the term ""a geothermal right"" already in use. But the people who have interest in geothermal development strongly feel that legislation should be introduced to enable them to develop and utilize, under legal protection, geothermal resources for electric power and other purposes, especially when the oil situation is difficult and energy is in short supply. Thus, it is necessary to enact a law incorporating all procedures necessary for promoting, positively and systematically, the development of geothermal resources in Japan.
LEGAL BACKGROUND
Since the current legal system in Japan lacks a basic law which ensures the right of geothermal development to the developer, adeveloper must file an applicationfor digging in accordance with the existing Hot Spring Law, inasmuch as thegeothermal substance that is an object for development and utilization is of the same quality as a hot spring (mineral water, heat, steam and gas issuing from under the ground), and also file an application in accordance with the Natural Park Law, because geothermal resources are often found at natural scenic places inside national or designated parks.
The Hot Spring Law, however, requires as a precondition the acquisition of the ownership or leasehold of the land where drillings are conducted. The landownership or leasehold provided for in the Civil Law controls not only the land surface but the space directly above or under the land. (The Civil Law does not specify the height and depth, but itis reasonable to interpret them as within the extenthuman beings can utilize at present.) Furthermore, landownership is a right to control land freely unless otherwise specifically restricted by other laws.
The Hot Spring Law was enacted in 1948. It Iis only a procedural law for administering hot spring hygienics, and as to the right relationship on land surface, it is interpreted that the right to control a spout is owned by a person who found the hot spring erupting from under the ground to the land surface, under a precondition that the land with a spout is owned or leased by the same person; this right is called the right of hot spring in the Hot Spring Law. (This right is called the primary right of hot spring, and .the right to draw hot water off a spoutis called the secondary
right of hot spring.')
The, right of hot spring is interpreted as one mode of exercise of landownership or leasehold (ownership or the right of use of the ground with a spout), which includes by nature the right of hot spring. But, as to the right to the source or vein of hot water underground which is regarded here as the geothermal resource, the Hot Spring
Law does not define clearly to whom it belongs or by whom is is controlled.
Accordingly, if we base on the interpretation as stated above that a hot spring or a geothermal resource deposited underground is controlled by the owner or user of the land, a geothermal developer has to face many difficult problems concerning right relationships. (There is no question if the developer owns the land, but purchasing an extensive tract of land at the beginning of development is normally impossible because of drilling risks, conditions of location for a power plant and other problems, and, therefore, it is common to rely on. leasing.) If a developer desires to borrow land, the landowner usually imposes conditions some of which are very difficult, and, even if the developer succeeds in obtaining the'lease, the landowner may take unilateral actions such as refusal to extend thelease contract term, cancellation of the lease contract, and so forth when the development is on the track. Thus, the developer is placed in a weak right status without stabilization on and under the ground.
When prospecting or boring for underground minerals is conducted under the Mining Law, the land must be borrowed to obtain leasehold, because the law does not authorize the right of use of the land surface; but the underground minerals designated by the law inside a mining area belong to the mining-right holder and exclude the right of the landowner to control the underground of his own land and, thus, makes the mining right a separate and independent right from landownership.
Even if agreement is not' reached with a landowner, the Director' of International Trade and .Industry reserves for mining-right holders an arbitration authority on the entry, use or expropriation of land, use of land and water inside a pit, and 50 on. As stated above, the country furnishes mining-right holders with various benefits for promoting the mining industry. In order to develop and utilize geothermal resources without hindrance and with stability, it is considered necessary for the country to enact a special law establishing some right, a geothermal right, which can be exercised for the development and utilization of geothermal resources within a fixed area (tentatively called the geothermal area) as in the case of the mining right, and also to exclude the right of a landowner at least as far as the underground geothermal resources are concerned.
In Italy and New Zealand, which are advanced countries in geothermal development, geothermal laws are already stipulated and, as in the case of the mining right, the geothermal right (prospecting, development and utilization) is granted by the government. It is noteworthy that a landowner is not allowed to object to geothermal development, but, instead, the landowner receives an appropriate compensation if the deposit is located atshallow underground levels, while he cannot insist on compensation or ownership if the deposit is located deep under the ground. In the USA, a geothermal resource lease law was enacted in 1970, and developers are granted the right to 'lease national lands or public lands for developing geothermal resources. The above examples indicate that each country is preparing laws and regulations under a distinct acknowledgment of the impor-
tance of geothermal development.
LEGAL PROBLEMS FOR PROMOTION
The development (survey, collection, utilization, etc.) of geothermal resources in our country has been done according to the Mining Law since the Meiji Era. The minerals to
2422 NAKAMURA, NAKAHARA, AND IGA

2423
which the Mining Law is applied,as the objects of the mining right are coal, oil, combustible natural, gas, uranium ore, and so on, in addition to gold, silver, copper, and others. From a standpoint of securing energy among others, the country has enacted special laws for the cultivation, promotion and rationalization of main mineral resources, recognizing strongly the importance of government participation and promotion, through the laws. For example, in order to encourage enterprises'to promote development of domestic energy resources, the Oil and Combustible Natural Gas Resources Development Law, the Power Source Development and Promotion Law, the Uranium Ore and other Nuclear Raw Material Development and Promotion Law, etc. were implemented in 1952. As to oil and eombustible natural gas, it was intended to improve digging methods and to promote prospecting in order to contribute to the public welfare through rationalized development of such resources. As to power source development, it was intended to prepare facilities necessary for generating hydraulic, thermoelectric and atomic power in order to increase the power supply and to contribute. to the development of the industries in our country. Also, it was intended to promote extraction of. uranium ore.
Since the oil crisis at the end of the year before last, the necessity of developing domestic energy resources has been'feltmore strongly, and, as a sourceof domestic energy, the geothermal resource'has drawn attention of both government and civil circles. Since the geothermal resource is not an object designated by the Mining Law' and there is no other law directly connected with its development and utilization, it is felt strongly that a basic law should define the nature and position of a right which can be called a geothermal right. After adjustment with existing related laws (Hot Spring Law, Mining Law, National Park Law, National Forestry Law, Power Enterprise Law, etc.), the Mining Companies Council (eight major companies and the Nippon Jukagaku Kogyo Co., Ltd., the Secretariat of the Japan Mining Association) has started deliberations on the draft of a law since the year before last. After passing through the steps stated hereunder, it is understood that the draft will be formalized into a bill for the Geothermal Resource Development and Promotion Law which will be submitted to the Diet shortly.
Legal Problems Hampering Development
Since there is no law directly aiming at the development and utilization of geothermal resources, a developer wishing to prospect and develop the resource has no choice but to apply for hot spring digging according to the Hot Spring Law. That is, according to the law, hot spring is ""hot water, mineral water and gas (excluding natural gas containing hydrocarbon as a main ingredient) which is 25°C or over in temperature and contains one of the 19 substances listed in the separate table."" Because steam and hot water, the objects for development and utilization of the geothermal resource, fall in ""hot spring"" designation in the same law, restrictions under the law are unavoidable when the resource is developed. As the Hot Spring Law defines ""hot spring"" from a welfare-administration aspect as a resource for sight-seeing and medical care, placing emphasis on the protection of the hot, spring and the adjustment of its utilization, it controls hot spring diggings from the administrative side but not from the side of rights relationships or the ·right of hot spring. Thus there are many cases of conflict, with landownership and other'rights.
In applying for drillings for hot water resources, the ownership or leasehold of the land where borings are made is a precondition. Besides, in our country, where the private property system or the landownership system is absolute and inviolable, a landowner may insist on many conditions ( use of' the .hot spring, high land price, strict conditions for the lease, and so on) to be fulfilled before the'landownership or leasehold is transferred to a developer wishing to develop geothermal resources, and, thus, land negotiations often labor under difficulties. The land for geothermal de.velopment is located in a forest or a field within a volcanic zone and, in many cases, it is a national forest or field. The use of land for geothermal development inside national lands is subject to the restrictions of the National Property Law, the Forest and Field Law and the Forestry Law. As the keynote of such laws is that the country owns underground springs, steam, and hot springs inside national lands as their components, a developer wishing to lease national lands is obliged. to accept a one-sided contract prepared by the government in the negotiations with a local forestry office. For instance, there still exists a government notification (Notification No. 305 of the Forestry Agency, issued in 1968) instructing that 30% of· the hot water or hot springs shall be the property of the country. Furthermore, electric power enterprises and the like are authorized to purchase or lease national lands if they are to be used for the public or for public utilities, whereas other enterprises are not allowed to purchase or lease national lands exceeding 5 hectares in area unless they are used for the public or for public utilities. There is no problem if geothermal electric power generation and the utilization of hot water are for the public or for public utilities but, if for other purposes, land of less than 5 hectares may be insufficient to meet the requirement for geothermal development. Such being the case, geothermal developments inside national lands are placed in an uneasy status. On the other hand, deforestation of a national forest, public forest or private forest is subject to various restrictions based on the Forestry Law.
In the meantime, geothermal zones are mostly located in volcanic zones and especially in areas where hot springs erupt abundantly. Those places are normally scenic spots within natural parks and, therefore, many restrictions are imposed upon geothermal developments (through the Natural Park Law and the Pollution Control Law)from the standpoint of protecting nature and the environment and preventing pollution. Although the Natural Park Law provides that, as for the activities of enterprises inside natural parks, attention will'bepaid to the adjustment of rights and benefits owing· to the enterprises (such as the right of hot spring, mining rights, and so forth based on landownership or leasehold by the enterprises) the adjustment tends to lean toward the maintenance of natural scenery, much hampering geothermal development aimed at the contribution to the energy supply. For instance, there is an agreement of March 1972 between the Environmental Agency and the Ministry of International Trade and Industry which restricted geothermal power generation to six areas in the whole country in order to protect environment and to prevent pollution.
In view of the recent movement for energy development, and also from'the standpoint that energy development can be harmonized with nature for coexistence, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry has indicated its preference toward easing the above agreement, but the agreement still remains as a cause of delay in the development plans of new geothermal enterprises.
GEOTHERMAL RIGHTS AND PROBLEMS OF LEGISLATION IN JAPAN
On the other hand, according to the Electric Power Enterprise Law, geothermal power generation facilities are treated like those for thermal (conventional-fueled) power generation, and the machinery and equipment used for geothermal power generation are treated as electric facilities whose maintenance and installation are governed by the law. However, regarding entry, use or expropriation of land owned by other persons, such privileges are authorized by the same law and the Land Expropriation Law to electric power enterprises, but not to geothermal developers. Accordingly, it is necessary to establish a new legal framework in which geothermal developers can advance their land counter-measures without difficulty in each stage of prospecting, development and utilization.
In addition, in the case where a geothermal developer intends to utilize geothermal resources for generating electric power, he cannot install a power plant nor supply electric power unless he has the license for an electric power enterprise required by the Electric Power Enterprise Law, except for power generation for his own use. One way he can choose is to obtain a permit for vending wholesale power to an electric power enterprise.
Contracting and negotiations with the power enterprise are necessary for it. Also, the geothermal developer can contract with a general electric power enterprise (power company) for transmitting power generated for his own use to nearby factories connected with the developer on behalf of the same power company; or, by concluding a contract with a power company, he can have it construct a power plant to which the geothermal developer simply supplies steam.
Accordingly, as a legal problem in geothermal power generation. it is desirable that the wholesale supply system, transit system, steam supply system, and so forth described above are legalized for geothermal development.
Mining Right and Ownership or Lease
As for geothermal resource development, not only in foreign countries but also in Japan, geothermal power plants have been constructed. Those in Japan are located at Otake, Matsukawa, Onuma. and elsewhere, and other development plans are being made. The steps in the development are, as in thecase of development of mineral resources designated by the Mining Law, land surface survey, trial boring, and collection. The start and implementation of mining are premised on the acquisition of landownership or leasehold. Under the Civil Law of our country, landownership is a private right which is absolutely inviolable and controls works above and under the ground for use, profit and disposition. Unless otherwise provided in laws for when land is used for public welfare, it is a principle that a landowner can freely dispose of any component of his land, including minerals. Against this principle, the country enacted the Mining Law on underground minerals and established the mining-right principle separately from landownership, excluding the minerals designated by the law from the object of landownership; the excavation of the minerals is possible only by the mining-right holder. The law provides that the mining right is a public right approved by the country, which is equal to a real right under the Civil Law as an exclusive private right on development and utilization of such minerals; it is a separate and independent right from landownership and can inclusively control unexcavated
minerals upon registration.
The mining-right holder, therefore, is competent to refuse any claim from the landowner or the land user on the underground minerals designated by the law.
As stated above, an enterprise is free in mining under the permission of the country, which has authority to grant a right to collect and own unexcavated minerals. But, although a landowner has no right on underground minerals, he has a right to use of his land surface. Accordingly, before an enterprise enters or uses the land surface for investigation, it has to acquire a right to use the land surface regardless of whether the land is located inside or outside their mining area. (There is no such problem if the enterprise purchases the necessary land, but the land for geothermal development is normally on a long-term lease basis, and more national lands are leased than public or private lands.) After borrowing the necessary area of land surface, the mining-right 1 holder can use the underground of his mining area and its related underground for borings and pits to the extent necessary for mining, and, therefore, he is not required to obtain the right of use of the underground separately.
The same applies to the mining outside under the land surface he is entitled to use. A landowner, however, still has a right to the use of the underground of his land, and this right is not totally suspended by the introduction of the mining right. For instance, he can dig a well if it is not for collecting minerals. So, it may happen that mining under the land surface belonging to the third person is hampered by digging of a well by the third person. Also, there is a case where a landowner' does not agree to the lease of his land from the beginning. In such a case, the adjustment of interests of both parties becomes necessary, but the Mining Law does not leave it to the free contract of each individual and approves a special right of use of underground where necessary under certain conditions; and. if a difficult situation arises, the following measures are taken. That is, regarding land entry, cutting of bamboo and trees, use and expropriation of land surface ( use of a pit entrance on land surface, and so on), the mining-right holder can ignore the right of a landowner according to the permission of the Director of the International Trade and Industry Bureau, and is allowed to use or expropriate a certain space of land.
As stated above, the Mining Law was enacted independently, with an object of establishing a fundamental system for mining in order to increase public welfare by developing mineral resources in a national way, and, as a law which can restrict landownership provided in the Civil Law, it is intended to contribute to the stabilization of right-relationship, for those who are willing to undertake mining.
Rights Under the Hot Spring and Civil Laws
The development of geothermal resources follows each step of prospecting (land survey, land entry and trial-well drilling); development (production-well drilling); planning of a plant; and industrialization. For prospecting and development, it will be necessary to own or borrow necessary land and to apply to the Prefectural Governor for diggings and borings according to the Hot Spring Law, until a geothermal basic law is enacted. The Hot Spring Law currently in effect was enacted in 1948, but, because the law was mainly for administrative control of diggings for hot springs and not for defining the right-relationships for hot springs or the right of hot spring, the legal relationship surrounding the right of hot spring has been left extremely unclear for
2424 NAKAMURA, NAKAHARA, AND IGA
2425
more than 20 years. Particularly, in the case of a hot spring digging on leased land, there have been many complicated problems on the relationships between the right of hot spring and landownership or leasehold.
The development of geothermal resources is being emphasized recently, and the method for expediting the development and introduction of an appropriate legal framework is being discussed, and there is no choice at present but to treat geothermal resources as hot springs under the Hot Spring Law. As a result, there arise complicated problems on the relationships among the rights to use geothermal resources such as steam and hot water, natural eruptions from underground, landownership, and leasehold. The relation of the Hot. Spring Law to landownership and leasehold under the Civil Law and also to the Mining Law is explained hereunder, placing particular emphasis on the Hot Spring Law and the history and transition of the hot spring concept.
Two types. Hot springs are of two kinds, naturally erupting springs and those artificially dug. Until the end of the Meiji Era, almost all hot springs were naturally erupting springs.
Those hot springs were considered by villagers as common assets belonging to their communities, because they had no idea of controlling them privately, thinking that ""the hot spring that came out of our land belongs to everybody. ., At the same time, they thought that not only the hot springs which came out of the land surface but those which might someday come out belonged to the communities. In a sense, the right of hot spring was Of the same nature as the right of the commons ( Iriai).
Through the reform of the land system (revision of land taX), private landownership was established under the Civil Law, and it was made clear that this modern landownership could control the space both above and under the ground and. therefore. the owner of the land with a spout could control the underground hot spring (the source or vein of a hot spring). But the old practice of common control over hot springs by village, prefecture or country before the Meiji Era (before land tax revision) continued even after Meiji times and conflicted with the modern landownership provided in the national law. The solution was sought in a different way depending on the conditions of each hotspring area. In the case of Atami, the ownership of land with a spout was returned to the country, and the people who had had the right to use the hot spring since the old days concluded land-lease contracts with the country and paid fees to the country for drawing on the hot spring. In other cases, the country transfered hot springs to prefectures, cities, towns and villages, or the land with a spout was conceded to a landowner according to the Civil Law. (Some landowners could not freely use the hot springs erupting from their own lands because of the old practices on the use of hot spring.) Or, a hot-spring area was divided among various people in order to get rid of common control, and each person registered his land. for complete control of his hot spring.
In the Taisho Era, as capital and labor were invested in artificial diggings, this trend was intensified and the right of hot spring under the old practice changed its nature and eventually disappeared. In the Showa Era, artificial diggings and private hot springs became common. However, when the war started, although the ownership of hot springs based on landownership. was guaranteed, each prefecture stipulated
regulations for restricting diggings and uses of hot springs, and the police were authorized to control them or to issue permits, because the principle of the Civil Law was that ownership was free within the scope and restrictions of the laws. As the war progressed, diggings of new hot springs came to a standstill due to the decrease of tourists, material shortages, and so on.
After the war, expanded democratization and individualistic ideas weakened the controlling power of the village groups and the police, and this trend accelerated the private ownerships of hot springs. In 1948, the current Hot Spring Law was enacted, and the past police administration was changed to the current welfare and health administration.
Different from the control of hot springs in prewar times, the current Hot Spring Law is not for prohibiting the acquisition or utilization of hot springs, but for confirming the private right to hot springs. Under such preconditions, the Law restricts or controls digging for hot water only when it has been found to be against public welfare, and leaves the right of permission to the prefectural governor. Also, the hot spring right is interpreted as one mode of exercise of landownership or leasehold and, therefore, the governor must permit digging if there is a specific reason.
Spout right and spout foundation. Regarding the rights of hot spring at the land surface, middle underground and deep underground, there are the spout right, the ownership of the spout foundation, and the right to use of spout foundation on the land surface, and also the ownership of the spring ""vein"" under the ground, each of which has substantive legal problems.
A spout or a headspring on the land surface can be physically controlled and utilized by a person. The right to control a spout from which a hot spring erupts is the spout right, and it is inclusive of the drawing and utilization of hot water, additional diggings, installation of a pump, etc. This right is called the primary hot-spring right and so is called hot spring ownership. (The secondary hot spring right is a right to draw or supply hot water.)
The ownership (and the right of use) of a spout foundation is the ownership (right of use) of the foundation of a spout from which hot water erupts. This right is distinguished in conception from the above spout right, but the ownership of the spout foundations is part of landownership, which has inclusive control over the land including spout foundation. But, under the modern landownership system of the Civil Law, as a realistic measure to harmonize both rights, there are many cases recently in which the spout right (the primary hot spring right) is treated as an independent right separated from the ownership of the spout foundation, by splitting the space of the spout foundation; thus, a new technique is used to make both rights coexist at the same level. A court has given legal approval to this new method. This means that economic advantage of spout control is so great that there are strong social and economical demands to treat it independently from the economic advantage,of spout foundation control. This method, however, is after all a matter of handling and, from a legal point of view, the spout right is unstable since it is included in the ownership of the spout foundation. To make the right stable, the spout right holder has to acquire the landownership or leasehold and, if a hot spring resulted from digging, he must acquire the spout right as the digger on his own land or on the
-leased land. If the land is leased, the landowner may cancel
the lease contract or refuse to extend the lease term. In
GEOTHERMAL RIGHTS AND PROBLEMS OF LEGISLATION IN JAPAN
2426
such a case, there remains a question whether or not the spout right (right to utilize the geothermal resource) can be reserved continuously for geothermal development even after the leasehold has expired.
According to the judicial precedents of the aforementioned court, there is a possibility that the spout right is treated as a separate right from the ownership of the spout foundation. Even if it is possible, the developer has to negotiate with the landowner on the splitting of the spout foundation. In the meantime, if the landowner does not agree to the extension of the lease term, or proposes to cancel the lease contract, the developer can insist on certain terms. That is, when the lease contract was concluded with the landowner for hot-spring digging for geothermal development, it was naturally anticipated that the lease would last for a long period and, therefore, if the landowner cancels the contract unilaterally, he should pay compensation for the damage; and also, if the landowner refuses to extend the lease term, he must give an acceptable justification, because the lease term itself is only for setting a period during which the amount of rent is fixed. It is well known that the government has recently been giving legal protection to leasehold.
Source and vein rights. A hot-spring source and vein are hot water under the ground to which a person's realistic control cannot reach, unlike a hot spring at the land surface. Accordingly, as with the mining right, to underground minerals, the right to such an underground spring is a conceptional right which can be managed or controlled with the approval of the society. Underground minerals, however, are legally approved as the object of the mining right. In this respect, the mining right is different from the right to the underground hot spring vein, which is not the subject of a special law. The Hot Spring Law covers hot springs on the land surface as the object of the law, but it does not clarify the right-relationship on underground hot springs.
Since the modern landowner controls, in principle, the space directly above and under his land, an underground hot spring (underground geothermal resource) constitutes part of the land which is owned and, therefore, theoretically the ownership of the underground hot spring vein cannot be recognized as an independent right separated from landownership. In this respect, the Hot Spring Law, as stated above, does not specify the owner of the right to the underground hot spring, while the Mining Law expressly defines the right to underground minerals.
In the past, underground resources were considered as public property and, therefore, there was some opinion that the right to utilize a hot spring, that is, the right to use public property approved by the country, should be recognized as the hot spring right, a separate and independent right from landownership like the mining right; but, under the current ownership and private-property system, the Constitution does not allow exclusion from landownership of underground hot springs (geothermal resources) which are an object of private ownership (landownership) unless otherwise provided in a law.
Accordingly. as to an underground hot, spring resource (underground hot spring vein) to which a realistic control cannot reach, it is necessary to have a conceptional control system whereby the underground hot spring can be managed and controlled through social agreement. Here is a defect in the Hot Spring Law and, because of this defect, the right to own or control geothermal fruits remains a fundamental problem for discussion.
Such being the case, if the underground hot spring resource cannot position itself in a unique control relationship similar to that of minerals under the Mining Law, and if there is no course but to interpret it for the time 'being as an object of landownership or leasehold, the first thing for the developer is the acquisition of landownership or a leasehold. This is currently the only assurance regarding the right to the geothermal resource, but, in the case of leasehold, the right is still unstable.
In prospecting a mineral ore, an inclined boring method may be used. When ore is found outside the leased land on which inclined boring began, the mining-right holder can control and own such ore even though the ore is deposited under the ground belonging to a third person; but, in the case of inclined boring for the geothermal resource, it is necessary to obtain the ownership or lease of the land under which the geothermal resource was found, otherwise the geothermal fruits do not belong to the developer. Meanwhile, the land under which the geothermal resource is deposited is much wider than the land directly necessary for development and utilization. Consequently, since landownership or leasehold has control only directly above and under the land, the right to the underground hot spring and the ownership or leasehold of the underground hardly coincide with the above right in area, and the scopes of those rights remain as a problem to be solved. Because of such instability and complexity of the rights relationships, the introduction of the concepts of geothermal area and geothermal right is strongly desired. As stated above, in order to establish a firm right to geothermal fruits, it becomes necessary to expressly define in a law the geothermal right as a right independent and free from landownership so that, as in the case of the Mining Law, geothermal developers can smoothly promote their enterprises without experiencing unnecessary frictions and • confusions with other persons
connected with the land.
Legislation in Foreign Countries
The countries which have introduced legal systems similar to our Mining Law include Italy, New Zealand, and other countries advanced in geothermal administration. Although there are some differences in legislation from country to country, each established laws on geothermal development with a clear consciousness of the importance of development.
Italy. In 1927, a Mining Law was introduced as a general law in Italy. It is applied not only to minerals but to underground energy that can be developed for industrial
purposes.
Geothermal energy, such as steam and gas, is treated as a kind of mineral of national importance, and the right of trial drilling or exploitation is granted by the government. The government, however, grants such a right only to applicants who have specified amounts of funds and recognized technical ability. On this point it differs from our Japanese Mining Law, which is more flexible in the qualification of applicants, and can grant such a right to, for instance, the applicant who applied first. Also, the Italian landowner inside the geothermal area approved by the government is not allowed to object to the use of his land by an authorized geothermal developer, but can claim an
appropriate amount of compensation.
New Zealand. The Geothermal Energy Law of New Zealand was enacted in 1953. The right of prospecting,
NAKAMURA, NAKAHARA, AND IGA
2427
exploitation or utilization is authorized by the government under specified conditions. The authorized developer has special privileges of entry, use and expropriation of land authorized, regardless of its surface or underground. The landowner can claim compensation for the use of the shallow underground near to his land surface, but not for the deep underground.
The United States. A Geothermal Steam Law was introduced in the USA in 1970. For promoting the development and utilization of geothermal steam, the government authorizes geothermal leases in principle for 10 years on national lands, public lands and the land inside certain areas designated by the government. The rent is a fee for using the land, equivalent to 10 to 15% of the proceeds of the steam the developer has received. The space necessary for a geothermal area is determined to be 2500 acres.
As stated above. the advanced countries regard geothermal development as an important industry in line with national objectives, For this reason, they have arranged legal systems necessary for developing geothermal resource positively, by defining the related rights, by giving privileges of land expropriation, and by taking other appropriate measures.
DIRECTION OF GEOTHERMAL LEGISLATION
The direction of geothermal legislation in Japan was described above as the problems in the current legal system. In all cases, geothermal developments are not receiving legal support for protection and assistance, and the problems are actually causing hindrances to the developments. This is because the demand for promoting geothermal development is, as a matter of fact, not reflected in the existing laws. Therefore, geothermal development is not properly positioned in the current legal system, unlike other enterprises protected by their related laws. Then, to which direction should this needed geothermal legislation proceed?
First, is it possible to attain the object by amending the existing laws? In case the Hot Spring Law is to be amended by changing the definition of ""hot spring"" to distinguish actual hot springs from geothermal substances, and by giving geothermal substance a legal standing as subject of a real right, as with minerals under the Mining Law it is not sufficient to change part of the law; the total structure of the law has to be changed, because the law takes a passive stance looking only to the conservation of hot springs, while the object of geothermal development is to promote industry by increasing energy. Thus, it is difficult to attain the object by changing the Hot Spring Law.
In the meantime, as to adding geothermal substance to the minerals designated by the Mining Law, geothermal substance, like stone and gravel, does not fit to the Mining Law in view of the establishment of limited area, the chemical and physical properties, and so forth which are requisites for minerals. Besides, unlike mining enterprises of various sizes working under mining liberalism and equal opportunities, geothermal enterprises have to be major enterprises with sufficient, funds and technical capabilities and, therefore, the principle of the Mining Law that the first applicant gets the right cannot apply to geothermal enterprises.
Since geothermal development aims at rationalized progress and the increase of public welfare, it cannot be placed under the Mining Law, which does not question the implementation capabilities of developers. On the other hand, there is another possibility: that of granting a geother-
mal enterprise a special license as a public enterprise. That is, a specified enterprise of national importance is licensed as a public enterprise and the right of management is reserved by the government. In specified actual cases, part of the right of management is transferred to the enterprise to make it responsible for management. Such enterprises include Japan National Railways, the Japan Development Bank, and local public enterprises. Besides, there are companics of a public-and-private mixed form which include International Telecommunication and Telephone Co., Ltd. and Electric Power Development Co., Ltd.; among licensed companies, there are gas and power companies which are perfectly private companies. A licensed enterprise performs part of the public administration, and both the government and the enterprise. stand in a special power relationship shaped by the government's assistances, restrictions, and supervisions; it is also possible for the right of management to be withheld. by the government. Geothermal developers should carefully study this type of enterprise.
As stated earlier, the protection of geothermal developments through amendment of the current laws was studied from various perspectives. That is, whichever one of the following we should choose: partial amendment of a law, solution through improvement of administrative measures, or acquisition of the geothermal right through the enactment of an independent law, will involve many problems. But seeking for a solution in the Hot Spring Law or the Mining Law seems to be difficult in theory and practice, inasmuch as the objects of such laws are essentially different from those of geothermal development. Accordingly, it becomes necessary to establish an independent law specifically defining the geothermal right under deep understanding of both government and citizens, using as references the legislation of geothermally advanced countries which are positively promoting geothermal development as an enterprise of national importance. The law should be a base for positive promotion of geothermal development.
The character the new 'law of geothermal right should
have is suggested in the ensuing sections of this paper.
BASIC DEVELOPMENT LAW STUDY
Based on the above conclusions, the Mining Companies Council has prepared a plan and studied it from various aspects. As an interim plan, the main points of the basic law have been summarized, but the overall final summarization will be made after further studies. A draft of the proposed basic law on geothermal development is as follows:
1. Object: The object of 'this law is to establish a system for developing and utilizing geothermal resource rationally and thereby secure domestic energy and promote the development of a local ·area.
2. Definitions of relevant terms. (a) Geothermal Resource: The geothermal resource is such a resource as gas and steam erupting from underground, or geothermal energy (for power generation: see below) deposited underground. (b) Development: The development consists of concentrating and collecting a large volume (10 000 000 cal/hr or more) of geothermal energy for generating power. (c) Geothermal Right: The geothermal right is a right to prospect and develop geothermal resources in specified registered areas (hereinafter referred to as a geothermal areas) inside a geothermal resource development zone. The right is a general term
GEOTHERMAL RIGHTS AND PROBLEMS OF LEGISLATION IN JAPAN
2428 NAKAMURA, NAKAHARA, AND IGA
for the right of trial drilling (prospecting right) and a development right, and, as a real right, is subject to the regulations on real property. The right of trial drilling (prospecting right) lasts for two years from the date of legislation, and its extension is limited to two times. 3. Unless under the geothermal right, the development of the resource or prospecting inside the geothermal area for the purpose of geothermal development is not allowed. The government has authority to grant a right to excavate and acquire a geothermal resource which is not excavated yet. 4. The government designates geothermal resource development zones (through the Minister of International Trade
and Industry). 5. The boundary of the geothermal area is drawn with straight lines, and its limit is the ground right under the boundary on the land surface. The size is 100 km2 for the right of trial digging (prospecting right) and 10 km2
for the development right. 6. The holder of the geothermal right must have a plan for prospecting and developing geothermal resources in a rational way and must have the technical ability to implement
it. 7. The application for the right of trial drilling (prospecting right) is filed to the government on a fixed day once a year. In this case, a document stating the operation plan must be attached to the application. 8. The same applies to the development right. 9. The development right can be applied for only by the holder of the right of trial drilling (holder of the prospecting right). 10. When the geothermal right has been applied for, the government must consult with the prefectures and executive agencies concerned. 11. After the geothermal right has been applied for, when the government has determined that the application meets the specified conditions and has completed necessary conSultations, the government approves and registers the establishment of the geothermal right. The geothermal right becomes effective from the date of registration.
12. The owner of the geothermal right or a person wishing to establish a geothermal right may, under the permission of the Director of the International Trade and Industry Bureau, enter the land belonging to a third person and may cut bamboos and trees. When it is necessary to use or expropriate land, he may apply to the Director for authori-
zation. 13. The country furnishes the geothermal-right holder with part of the expenses necessary for his enterprise, or advances necessary funds and also allows special treatment in taxation. 14. The geothermal right can be an object of mortgage or security (development right). 15. The government must conduct a basic investigation of geothermal resources in the entire country every year. 16. Partial amendment of the Hot Spring Law. (a) When the geothermal right holder has applied for hot-spring drilling to the prefectural governor, the governor must grant permission if there is no fear that the drilling affects the volume of the erupting hot spring, temperature, or ingredients; and if the application meets the conditions set forth in the Geothermal Law. (b) The provisions of the Hot Spring Law do not apply to trial drilling (prospecting) and the development of geothermal resource to which the Geothermal Law is applied.
The above are the contents of the draft of the basic law for geothermal development, but the characters of the existing laws and surrounding situation being such as stated earlier, presenting the basic law at this time might invite fundamental discussions on the geothermal right. This could result in,the delay of geothermal developments, and, therefore, the following bill in the form of a promotion law, within the framework of the existing laws, is being prepared forsubmission to the Diet as a resolution by House members of the Liberal Democratic Party.
PROMOTION LAW DRAFT
The first draft of the main principle of the proposed promotion law was published on March 8, 1974, and the second draft on April 4, 1974. The mining industry has agreed to the draft in principle. The gist of the draft is as follows:
1. The government is to promote smooth and efficient development of geothermal resources. 2. A basic investigation of geothermal resources is to be implemented by the government. 3. The government decides on a basic plan of geothermal development, and designates zones, and so on. 4. Geothermal developers may engage in developments under the approval of the government. 5. The administrative organs of the government give due consideration to the smooth development of geothermal resources. 6. The government assists geothermal developers in obtaining necessary funds or loans. 7. The geothermal developer who does not abide by this law is subject to appropriate penalties. 8. Geothermal developers already engaged in development are regarded as the developer under this law once they have reported their operations to the government.
IMMEDIATE-RIGHT RELATIONSHIPS
Supposing the promotion law summarized above passes the Diet, the geothermal zones will be designated and the developers inside those zones will be recognized by the government and they will receive cooperation and assistance from the local public organs or administrative agencies related to geothermal development. Thus, it is recognized that the development of geothermal resources is legally accorded a significant right-like framework, whereby the development is expected to advance effectively a step further. However, even though a legal framework is given by the country, it is after all ""right-like"" and not the right itself. Consequently, reconciliation with 'the existing laws needs to be continued in the process of implementing the promotion law. There may be a case where the restrictions for protecting scenic beauty provided in the Natural Park Law conflict with the designation of geothermal zones. Also, ownership or leasehold is still necessary in applying for a digging or drilling under the Hot Spring Law, even though it is for geothermal development; also, if the developer fails,to lease necessary land, there is no way' to save it, since the land-use or expropriations authorized in foreign legislation (or authorized under the Mining Law in our country) will not be applicable. Even though local public authorities stipulate regulations for assistance, it is feared

that land negotiation will not become easier than before.
In addition, in case a geothermal developer has drilled for and acquired geothermal fruits such as steam or hot water, there is no basic 'law by which he can own and utilize them as a right endorsed by the nation, as in the case of underground minerals which can'be exempted from landownership rights and owned by the developer according to the Mining Law. Therefore, the developer must still acquire the landownership as the base of a right to own and utilize his fruits. But there is a limiting factor in the need to acquire a vast tract of land from the beginning of development, and also, as the land where geothermal resources are latent is mostly national lands, it is normal to lease the land, in cases where purchase of local public or private lands was not successful, the only way left is
land lease. Consequently, the current situation is that the developer is obliged to obtain leasehold from the landowners (country, public organs or private persons). In view of this, the developer has no other recourse but to seek ownership of his geothermal fruits in leasehold, but ownership based on leasehold is unstable in view of the nature of leasehold. Since there are more problems to be solved, and it conceivably will take much more time before a basic law centering on the geothermal right can be introduced, it is considered, necessary for geothermal developers to direct their efforts toward early introduction of the promotion law, which is ahead of the current legal system in regard to legal consciousness of the coming rights relationship as stated in this paper.
